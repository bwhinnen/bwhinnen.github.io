title: Must do this more often
summary: What we've been doing in the past few months, especially hockey. Braden has been playing the Kids Recreational League and we are looking forward to C-Grade.
oneliner: Posting shouldn't be work, but it does feel like it sometimes.
excerpt: But it feels like work sometimes. Having to think of a subject rather than just rambling on about nothing at all does seem a little tedious at times ...

<p><section><p>But it feels like work sometimes. Having to think of a subject rather than just rambling on about nothing at all does seem a little tedious at times. Perhaps I am not cut out to be a blogger, probably why I am an I.T. Geek instead, although calling me a geek is a little bit of a misconception as I am a little above that pay-grade!</p></p>

<p>However I am digressing! When I re-vamped this blog I had all the good intentions of writing about things everyday, when in reality instead of picking subjects with substance (or not) I should have been concentrating on what the family was up to and writing things about us ... now that makes much more sense.</p>

<p>So what to write about from a family perspective for my first post back after such a long time away, yes, yes I know not as long as last time!</p>

<p>What have we done? Nothing? No, not really. Where have we been? Every where, well again, not really ...</p>

<p>Since July we've been the usual family trying to make life as enjoyable as possible, nothing out of the ordinary there really. Braden started playing ice hockey at the Gold Coast rink in the KRL, no not that mob-run (allegedly) league in Russia, but the Kids Recreational League. It is made up of three teams who play two weeks in a row and then have a bye, they have enough players to make two lines, one of older/bigger kids and the other of younger/smaller kids. The skill levels vary a great deal from those that can't really skate to those that have played at a state level. It is well run and Braden is really learning to play well, when it is not "too tired" that is.</p>

<p>So far he has only had one assist, not bad considering he doesn't really get into the action too much and likes to hang back, but he has also had a third and first star of the game. The third star was an encouragement award, but the first star was deserved. He played his best game ever that weekend, he was in on the plays, up and down the ice, making a supreme effort, happily staying on the ice and just doing a really good job overall. To say we were proud is an understatement.</p>

<p>Vicki and I have not been as active as we should be, but fingers crossed that will be changing soon with the startup of the development league, or C-grade. Where games will be run as a training/scrimmage session to allow us to get to know the positions, the rules and what is expected of us on the ice. This is to get us ready to move to B-grade for the next regular season, mainly because there were some "issues" with the season just completed, where new players were "inserted" into pre-existing teams and the outcome was not what I call friendly at all. The new league starts up in just over a week so we need to get signed up and ready to go, pretty excited about it actually!</p>

<p>Our life has not just been ice hockey, we've just recently come back from a vacation to the Hawaiian Islands, and this time I can really say that as we didn't just spend time on Oahu, we went to Hawai'i itself as well (also know as the Big Island) and spent a week there. Besides the abysmal attempt at customer service by both QANTAS and Jetstar airlines we made it there and back safely, in the end. Suffice it to say we will NEVER book a flight through one airline where some legs may be by another carrier, it just ends up with far too much finger pointing and a complete lack of professionalism on either parties behalf.</p>

<p>The vacation though was excellent, we had the best time and returned with many great memories, and photos. I will have to figure out if I can link to a shared photo stream or if I have to add photos here individually, only time will tell. I will write more detailed posts on some of the things that we did while on both islands as it is far too much for a single post (not to mention giving me subject matter that will span weeks instead of days ... oops I shouldn't readily admit that should I?).</p>

<p>As with all vacations it is always sad to have to come home, this time especially as Vicki didn't have a job to come back to after being "let go" due to financial re-structuring at her last job. It was a shame as she loved the company, the staff and the job, although I think the hardest part was leaving her friends behind who have more work to do to fill the gaps. On the bright side though she did find a new job in record time and the hours are now "school hours" which means she starts at 8:30am and finishes at 3:00pm daily, which means I do not have to pick up Braden every afternoon from school, although I could if I wanted to and will in situations where Vicki has to work back.</p>

<p>One thing the vacation has done is re-affirmed our desire to move to the United States of America, to that end we've both entered the Diversity Lottery (Green Card Lottery) for entry in 2014 as a fall back in case I cannot organise something else. The wonderful, yes sarcasm, thing is that we put our entry into the lottery in October but do not find out until May, and then have to wait for the next round of steps before getting the card in 2014. Patience is not really one of my virtues to be entirely honest!</p></section>
