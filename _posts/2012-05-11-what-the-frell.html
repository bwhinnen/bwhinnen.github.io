<p><section></p>Is going on with the Red Sox at the moment? I mean seriously what is going on? They have less than a .500 rating at the moment and are really playing hot and very very cold. This is the worst I have seen them play early in the season since starting to follow them. It seems that every time I look at the MLB website I see a loss, very sad. I am beginning to wonder if the loss of Varitek is such a missing piece.</p></p>

<p>The other thing is it seems that the NHL Season is winding down, where we would have at least a game a night to watch now there is lucky to be two or three a week which is pretty disappointing. I can now see why people get withdrawals from their favourite sports during the off season. The Caps and the Rangers play again on Sunday our time and I think it will be an absolute brilliant hard fought game! Then and finally then round 3 of the Stanley Cup finals can begin!</p>

<p>I am actually very glad it is the weekend, it has been a very long week and a very busy one at that. The other person that does what I do at work for the entire APAC region was overseas for the start of the week which meant I was holding the APAC timezone on my own. A couple of completely crappy days were had and thankfully the case load wasn't as high as it could have been.</p></section>
