<p><section><p>Who knew? Not me, and definitely not Vicki. Three hockey bags full of equipment, three sticks, one adult length, one intermediate, and one junior as well as plenty of room for all of us three. I thought I'd fit it in there, but was amazed at just how much room there is in such a small little car. Of course if we were a bigger family it never would do and we'd have to get the roof rack Vicki was thinking.</p></p>

<p>I am very glad that everything fits in the car as I didn't want to have to buy more stuff just to get to and from hockey, nor did I want to have to drive two cars as it would cost us a fortune in tolls!</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the day Vicki and I take to the ice for the first time in full hockey equipment, it is going to be rather interesting and I for one will probably get little sleep tonight just thinking about it.</p></section>
