<p><section><p>We've had Vicki's mum down here for the weekend and it seems like it never stopped. Funnily enough, we didn't stop, Friday was just a night catching up, Saturday was skate school in the morning, followed by shopping at Chermside and some lunch and an hour or so relaxation at home before heading back out. Vicki got a message about women's hockey training that was to occur on Saturday night and we all convinced her that she should go, so she did.</p></p>

<p>I think she was a little shocked at how the training was run as it was a pretty full on warm up with the "Browns" who are an open age team with the near top echelon of players in Queensland (well some of them anyway). She had a great time though and made a few new friends as well I believe, which is always a good thing when doing something you enjoy.</p>

<p>This morning was then a very early start having junior hockey practice for Braden at Acacia Ridge Iceworld, which is now re-opened, FINALLY. They had one and a half hours on the ice this morning from 7:30am, the boy does have an upper respiratory infection that seems to be a little persistent, and a relatively busy weekend but still was a trooper trying his hardest out there and still had a great time, seeing his huge smile while he is doing things is just awesome!</p>

<p>But one problem with this hectic weekend we have all started to get sick, Braden with his persistent cough, and Vicki feeling run down and I've got the same as Braden, hoping it clears up quickly as I want to get out to hockey practice again, yes it was that much fun! So hopefully I'll be able to make an appointment to see the doctor tomorrow and make sure I nip this in the bud as soon as possible.</p><section>
