summary: A general update on what has happened in recent times, poor Braden had a rough night vomiting everywhere and Vicki and I spent the night with him.
onliner: I should update, even if I have nothing mind-blowing to say.
excerpt: I really should. I find that I try and find something really meaningful to write about, something mind-blowingly awesome, but of course never find anything ...

<p><section><p>I really should. I find that I try and find something really meaningful to write about, something mind-blowingly awesome, but of course never find anything. What I should be doing is just writing things that happen, after all this is what I wanted to do with the blog rather than trying to be all 'clever' and 'sophisticated'!</p></p>

<p>So what I will be trying to write things that are happening around here and in my and our lives. It won't be prize winning prose but at least it will be honest and real.</p>

<p>Today is Friday, I'm taking a mental health day, yes I do need it, but to top things off the poor boy had an episode last night with some vomiting, well three counts of vomiting on his way to the bathroom. One in his bedroom, one in the family room and one at the entrance to the bathroom. All at around 1:00am this morning. Poor little tacker, he was thrown in the shower while we cleaned up. I must admit that is my most hated job in the world, cleaning up after someone that has been sick is never fun.</p>

<p>He has been up all night, and is still awake at 11:00am, but as of 7:00am he has stopped vomiting, which is a relief, but is now running a wondrous 38.9ÂºC temperature. But he is now taking fluids and medicine as well as eating a few Arnott's Milk Arrowroot biscuits and is actually quite lucid for someone who is running a fever and has a distinct lack of sleep.</p>

<p>Vicki had to go into the office this morning for a few hours to do the banking as her boss was away, which I am sure was a real chore on just a few paltry hours sleep. We are now all just relaxing at home doing very little for the rest of the day as the boy recovers and we keep a close eye on him.</p></section>
