<p><section><p>Today was Game 5 between the Devils and the Flyers, being played at the Wells Fargo Centre in Phildelphia. I say today but of course I am a day ahead of the USA so it was played on Tuesday night there of course. Now was it the re-introduction of Rinaldo, the loss of Giroux or the complete miss-handle by Bryzgalov that cost the Flyers the game? Or will they blame the very close offside call which resulted in a goal? Who really knows, but one thing we do know is that the Flyers fan-base really are a fickle bunch. Most of them booing their own team or leaving early. The few remaining fans actually cheering the team when they acknowledged the crowd at the end of their season.</p></p>

<p>Why did the Flyers lose in four straight games? Because the Devils (unlike the Pens) had a solid penalty kill and refused to play down at the Flyers level of retaliation play. Something other teams should really take on board for future meetings with them. In this game the Flyers were completely outclassed by a better team, a team that played as a team, that seemed to be everywhere on the ice at once (most of the time).</p>

<p>We currently have the Western Conference finals ready to go with the Kings and the Coyotes, which will prove to be an interesting series, the Kings have been dominating, but I really don't think either the Canucks or the Blues were playing at their best. The Coyotes have been playing hard but really did dominate the Preds. I'm going for the Coyotes on this one, purely because I don't like the City of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Eastern Conference still has three teams competing, the Devils have moved up, now it is between the Caps and the Rangers. Two rather interesting teams, two rather interesting sets of players and one coach that likes to whinge and whine a great deal, oh and of course drop the f-bomb more than me! Really I want the Rangers to win this one, but ultimately I don't think it matters as the Devils are the team I want to take the Conference finals and then step it up to the Cup!</p></section>
