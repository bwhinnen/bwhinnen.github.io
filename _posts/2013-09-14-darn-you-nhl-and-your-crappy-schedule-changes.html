title: Darn you NHL and your crappy schedule changes!
oneliner: NHL changed the schedule and the Penguins will not play at home when we are there.
summary: We're heading off to Pittsburgh for Christmas. We checked the last 6, SIX years of NHL schedules before deciding on dates and the Penguins were always home over that period.

<p><strong>Well thank you NHL</strong>, but with the devision realignment the schedules all changed! So that means for the entire time we are in Pittsburgh the Pens are not at home! Thankfully they are playing a game in nearby Ohio and then in New Jersey so we at least get to do a bit of a road trip to watch some games but we don't get to see them in CONSOL, which is what we really wanted.</p>

<p>The irony/bad luck is that we arrive into JFK on the 21st of December, the same day the Pens play at home, but getting from JFK to Pittsburgh via car before the puck drops at midday is just not going to happen.</p>

<p>We aren't going to let this get us down though as we are going to thoroughly enjoy our time in Pittsburgh and see as much as we can. We are going to be searching Mount Lebanon and Cecil Township for potential places to live in the future, although as nice as Cecil looks I think Mount Lebanon will win due to the closeness to other amenities (such as ice rinks) and of course just a short ride to Pittsburgh itself.</p>

<p>The count down is now under 100 days and I can tell you things are starting to get exciting! Not only that, but the NHL season start is just around the corner so we'll have plenty to keep us occupied as the time counts down!</p></section>
