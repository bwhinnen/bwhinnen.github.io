summary: I am slack, but everyone knows that, I only do things I want to do. This time it is all Hockey!
oneliner: Sickness, it really saps your will to do anything.
excerpt: That I am. My excuse is that I've been sick and not feeling like doing much at all. A "friend" referred to it as the Man Flu ...

<p><section><p>That I am. My excuse is that I've been sick and not feeling like doing much at all. A "friend" referred to it as the Man Flu, I tell you it was not said version of the flu, it was the full blown thing, not that it incapacitated me but I was feeling rather weary and had a distinct lack of motivation and energy.</p></p>

<p>I am still not at 100%, heck I'm not really at 70%, but I will still be heading to hockey practice tonight as I want to get out and who knows some exercise in really cold conditions might be good for me?!?! Yeah I know silly, but I don't want to miss practice! Speaking of which with Vicki's mum down here last weekend and me being sick early this week I've not been on the ice since Saturday morning and am really missing it and know I will feel a bit wobblier than usual when I get on tonight. But it is all for a good cause.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went into the office to work, of course there was an ulterior motive, I wanted to drop into Skatebiz to try on a size 9 skate in the Easton line up, which I did. Unfortunately they were as pre-thought, too small. Only just though, I'd say I would get away with a 1/4 size up from that, but not to worry, I have a set of 9.5D Easton EQ50's on order, yes the very same skates that I am sure Vicki will kill be for buying, but I don't care! Mind you I think it will be at least four weeks before they get here ... Of course I am getting a pretty good deal on them too so I am not overly concerned, my trusty EQ10's will do until then.</p>

<p>I am also a little disillusioned with the Speech Pathologist that Braden sees on a weekly basis. She did a report up detailing where he is up to so we can look to get some further assistance in the class room. The report was nothing out of the ordinary, but she put a comment on the bottom to call if we want to discuss, well I did, and I did call, only to leave a voice message. Which I did clearly, I also rang form my mobile phone which does not hide the number. That was a week ago now, and she still has not called back, I am not the happiest camper out there at the moment, not in the slightest. Given her report I would have thought that she would be working on more than just 's' or 'r' pronunciation and start working on structure and the correct use of words, but no, she still insists on this rubbish while a good thing does not help Braden to communicate! A lisp or a 'w' sound to some letters does not cause problems with communication like not being able to fully express himself!</p></section>
