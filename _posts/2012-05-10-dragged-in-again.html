title: Dragged in ... AGAIN
oneliner: I got dragged into a conference call for work (not my core job) to answer some questions.
summary: I can see what the issue is, I can see where it happens, and I can say it wasn't me ... but is that what they really want to hear?
excerpt: I don't know how I manage to do it or why I do it to myself. I somehow seem to get dragged into things at work that really ...

<p><section><p>I don't know how I manage to do it or why I do it to myself. I somehow seem to get dragged into things at work that really I shouldn't be. There should be an entire level or two between me and the need to be customer facing for some things. In this instance I'm the developer of a software solution at work (not my usual role but something I took over about five or six years ago), I support the code, delivery kit, sales collateral, training etc in my spare time. A support case was opened and I have been called in to look at things and act as a liaison with another vendor, which is all fine and dandy, but rather than having the local support team involved with the customer they feel the need to pull me into the mix. Yes I can do it, but really, I should be working with the third party vendor on this only, the local teams, from account management, customer support, application support etc should be the ones fronting the meetings, not the developer.</p></p>

<p>Really do they want me in the meeting so I can say "See this single line of code ... this one small line where one variable is assigned the value from another? That is where it is failing." Do I know why? Well yes as a matter of fact I do know why, but I don't have the ability to work around it as I am reliant on that command working and there is no way to fork it off while we complete the rest of the logic flow. Crappy programming language, or sorry interpreted scripting language!</p>

<p>That was pretty much my evening unfortunately.</p></section>
