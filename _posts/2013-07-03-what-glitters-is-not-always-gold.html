<p><section></p>Did you know that according to several studies and so-called boffins that you should be happy if you meet three certain criteria. Article link can be found here on the <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health-fitness/deakin-university-surveys-reveal-golden-triangle-of-happiness/story-fni0dgux-1226672800578" target="_blank">Herald Sun</a> website. Yes I am talking about the so-called "golden triangle of happiness". Let me just simply state that there is no such thing as a "golden triangle of happiness", anyone who believes this really has no understanding of the depth and breadth of mental illnesses such as depression with all it pertains. In a so-called <em>enlightened</em> society to have this touted in a <em>Lifestyle</em> section of a major media outlet is a travesty and undermines the excellent work done by so many health workers and organisations around the country and indeed the world.</p>

<p>Anyone who has suffered from a mental illness knows that it does not differentiate, it does not care who you are, what you have or how <em>happy</em> you should be. For many it is a dark and lonely battle that is fought on many fronts, alone because of opinions like this and the stigma associated with them. People are often too scared to confide in others for fear of what they will say, how they will react and more often than not comments such as "You are exaggerating, just snap out of it" or "It is just a phase, everyone gets down from time to time" and of course the old "You have the best life, family, friends, money, a job, you want for nothing, you have no reason or right to be un-happy!". Starting to sound familiar? Of course it is, especially from the vast majority people out there have not suffered from depression and as such do not understand what you are going through or have been through but believe they do based on pre-conceived ideology. Some people do of course understand, and these people are to be cherished!</p>

<p>How can I say this? Quite simply my life has been many ups and downs, much the same as everyone else, well so I thought. I was one of those people who thought to myself, "just snap out of it, you have no reason to be like this", but I could not, really it was just denial on my part. I've spent many years in a state of overwhelming turmoil, that is the easiest way to describe it in few words without spending an eternity trying to explain the variances of feelings. There are very few people that know this about me, and even less that had a clue that there was something wrong. That does not mean they are not observant, it simply means that like so many with depression I hid it extremely well. People would see mood swings, but never the full extent of how I was feeling internally, they would put it down to having a bad day or week. So yes I can to some extent, say that I do understand what people go through with depression as it is something I am currently going through, something that I want to change and have finally called out for help with.</p>

<p>The article really does not help anyone, it does not help those suffering from depression, nor does it help those close to those suffering or the general population who already have pre-conceived ideas. All it does is put mental health issues back into the darks days of medicine, when there was little understanding of the issues let alone the causes. I've seen many different reactions from people that I know when I've told them I am suffering from depression and that I am now on medication to help me get to a place where I can at least sort some things out and the underlining message in this article really solidifies some of those <del>poor</del> uneducated attitudes.</p>

<p>Really the article in general takes the whole plethora of mental health issues and glosses them over with three simple rules that will make ones life <em>happy</em>. It is a slap in the face to anyone who suffers from depression whether or not they meet those three criteria. Honestly who thought that publicising such findings in the way they did would be a good idea; it will not suddenly make those suffering change, it will not make things <em>all better</em> just knowing that they <em>should</em> be happy according to someones interpretations of findings made in 29 surveys over 12 years. If only life were that easy. I like so many people meet all three criteria and still suffer from depression and now things have just been made that much more difficult with peers when they realise that I really have no reason to be depressed at all.</p></section>
