<p><section></p>See I told you we'd skip some :)</p></p>

<p>This is his eighth practice, but at Acacia Ridge this time, on their brand new ice. The practice was also run by the Southern Stars and was a pretty good practice I must say. One and a half hours long, and even though he took some time getting up I know he thoroughly enjoyed himself!</p>

<p>Unfortunately You Tube has decided that the music is copyrighted so we cannot show you the video until we redo the music track on it.</p>

<p>This one is to <em>Sunshine </em>by<em> David Guetta </em>and<em> Avicii</em>.</p></section>
