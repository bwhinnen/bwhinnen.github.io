summary: Changing the Pittsburgh vacation to allow Braden to stay in school for two extra weeks means a potential white Christmas.

<p><section><p>I posted a while back that we would be going to Pittsburgh for Halloween. Well after consideration we decided that taking Braden out of school for a couple of weeks was probably not the best idea so I put a suggestion to Vicki.</p></p>

<p>Christmas! Yes a potential white Christmas in Pittsburgh. Probably one of the better ideas I've had recently. It was settled pretty quickly and I can say that now we've booked flights, accommodation and the hire car we need.</p>

<p>The trip will be more than just Pittsburgh, we will be flying from Brisbane to Honolulu then to New York via Hawaiian Airlines, picking up the car and driving across PA to Pittsburgh, I'm excited and a little apprehensive about the drive given we will not know the weather conditions until we get there and of course the 10 hour red-eye flight from Honolulu to New York. We will be in Pittsburgh for around eight days and hope to catch a few hockey games as well as practices for the Penguins. That is a bonus to the trip, we are using it to decide if we really do want to move there and if so where we could live. We've been given Mount Lebanon as a potential place by an ex-burgher and it is one of the areas we will be researching.</p>

<p>The trip will also include a couple of days out where we drive to see Niagra Falls on the way to Toronto, Vicki really wants to go to Canada this time and we are going to take the opportunity to see the Hockey Hall of Fame and maybe catch a hockey game in Toronto as well (maybe).</p>

<p>The way home will include a few dye in New York City itself followed by a flight back to Hawaii to relax and recuperate before the flight home. All up we are spending three weeks away and we are really looking forward to the break and also seeing more of the United States of America and especially meeting the people of Pittsburgh.</p></section>
