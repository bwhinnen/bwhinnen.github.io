title: Another day, another blister
oneliner: Work is busy, skating is fun, Braden picks up girls and Vicki gets to train with the Women's team.
summary: Really work can be very busy at times and sometimes it is just to omuch to finish in the day and rather than passing onto the next shift I leave work until the next day (as long as the customer doesn't mind). Skating is really a great relaxation time, especially in light of the busy work day.
excerpt: It was an advert from the 90's I think, or it could have even been from the 80's I can't quite remember. Nor can I remember the actual item ...

<p><section><p>It was an advert from the 90's I think, or it could have even been from the 80's I can't quite remember. Nor can I remember the actual item they were advertising! But that proverb has pretty much summed up my last couple of days at work. Usually I finish up around the time I am supposed to but the last couple of days I've gone an hour over time, and today I had to leave work for tomorrow which I absolutely hate doing. But enough of work :)</p></p>

<p>Last night was a skating night, and great night it was, relatively quiet night and room to move and have a bit of fun. For me it was just a night for skating around rather than trying new things or practising for skate school. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the night and the hour and a half on the ice after the day I had yesterday. It seems that for me ice skating is just a nice relaxing thing to do, I just wish it wasn't so expensive so I could do more of it!</p>

<p>Braden of course did his usual and picked up a few girls, and I say girls I mean girls in their mid to late teens, they just seem drawn to him. He is pretty smug about it too when we ask him about his 'girlfriends' :) Vicki was asked if she wanted to join the women's ice hockey team and training sessions, and I think she will as well, which will be awesome for her, except it will probably mean she gets further and further ahead of me in skill level :) But I think it was really nice of them to ask her.</p></section>
