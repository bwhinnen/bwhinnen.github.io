summary: Skate school is winding down and we will start to get our Saturday mornings back. However that really means we end up doing the much needed work around the house instead.

<p><section><p>Saturdays have turned into busy days for us lately although the mornings can start a little later due to skate school starting at 10:00am. I for one had a Â bit of a sleep in this morning as did Braden, which he needed as he has a chesty cough and a little tired. The later waking up both this morning and Friday morning really helped Braden to keep going today while we were out and about.</p></p>

<p>Firstly we had skate school this morning and I am happy to say all of us have passed to the next levels, Braden moving from Novice 1 to Novice 2 and Vicki and I from Intermediate 1 to Hockey 1. I know that the instructor of us wanted to move us up, me a little prematurely as she knows that a) we don't need to know 3-turns and b) they aren't the easiest to do in hockey skates. I hear that Braden did a great job in his class this morning and really impressed his instructor, which is awesome work. Now we need to decide what we will do in the next 4 weeks of class, whether we transfer over to a Thursday afternoon so we can attend Hockey 1 or do we just use the 90 minutes on the ice for practice?</p>

<p>We followed this up by heading to Skatebiz to get some kit for Vicki and myself, this ended up taking longer than expected, but in reality it was time well spent. We both ended up with different helmets than we first though, both moving from the Bauer 2100 to an Easton Stealth S9, but the fit was so much more comfortable. Both helmets need to be ordered in, but that is not a problem as we won't be practicing for a few weeks yet. Vicki ended up getting some Bauer gloves, some X15's and decided she would get some pants as well and ended up getting Bauer X20's. I ended up getting some Easton S11 gloves, and wow they feel so good to use, can't wait to use them on the ice! We also grabbed a new bag for Braden so I could use the bigger one, we ended up with a small version of the Easton S10 small wheeled bag.</p>

<p>This afternoon was a very late lunch at Nandos and then a trip home to do some needed yard work for me, mowing the back yard of our yard and also the neighbours yard and Vicki getting stuck into some housework and re-arranging the hockey kit bags. Really not a very exciting finish to the day, but a necessary one to make sure we can do the fun things!</p></section>
