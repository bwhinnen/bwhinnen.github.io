title: Oh noes! Inter-webs broken
oneliner: Kookaburras really do love to break the waterproof sheath on cables.
summary: The inter-webs is broken and that means I have to visit the office to do work and sadly that Telstra has to come out yet again to fix things!
excerpt: This is a bit of a post to encompass both yesterday and today! Why? Because the inter-webs is broken, well today I am accessing it tethered to my iPhone ...

<p><section><p>This is a bit of a post to encompass both yesterday and today! Why? Because the inter-webs is broken, well today I am accessing it tethered to my iPhone which really reminds me of the slower speeds we used to receive when dial-up was the only affordable connection method.</p></p>

<p>Yesterday I had to head into the office and it was a busy day with cases, not to mention the hour and three quarters spent in the car getting to and from the office. I makes for a long day on its own without taking into consideration a hefty case load as well or of course the 50 million questions you get because of the novelty of having one of the senior support staff actually in the office! I think I spent around an hour and a half discussing problems, configs and solutions with various account team members and engineers. It is good for them though as they don't often get to speak to a so-called subject matter expert (well I am supposed to be one of them!).</p>

<p>This morning the Telco Field Service Engineer arrived at my home to look at my connection, sadly he shook his head and muttered about other calls in my area for the same issues. It seems that there is a problem in the area related to the actual network (or should I say NOT-work) and upstream synchronisation. Usually I have this problem when the outdoor cable splitter is corroded, but since they replaced my cable run from the street a few years ago that hasn't been happening so no quick fix this time.</p>

<p>So here I sit with my Mac Pro connected to my iPhone for inter-webs and my work laptop connected to the dill-berry (BlackBerry) for work inter-webs with a sick boy sitting in the lounge room watching TV hoping that I do not need to go into the office today. Although I know Braden will love the adventure of going into the city and my work as he always does.</p></section>
