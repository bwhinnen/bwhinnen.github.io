<p><section><p>I've trademarked the title as it was coined by the great duo over at <a title="Hockey's Finest - girls who dig hockey!" href="http://hockeysfinest.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hockey's Finest</a> and I think it is quite clever!</p></p>

<p>We've had a couple of what I term suspect hits over the last few days, the first being Ovechkin on Girardi. First view of that hit was "WTF Ovi!". I'm not Ovechkin's biggest fan, far from it, and he has displayed some rather poor judgement on hits in the past, but this was in my eyes blatant. He took a cursory swipe at the puck with his foot and then launched himself at Girardi, it looked to be a) leaving his feet and b) targeting the head. Looking at the slow motion video replays showed he hit shoulder to shoulder and that he may or may not of left his feet. I still think it was a targeted hit, so I guess the NHL are lucky it is not me who is in charge of player safety!! Shanahan decided that there was no malice to the hit, and that Girardi saw Ovechkin coming and there was no evidence of anything but a clean hit. I strike this up as a lucky one for Ovechkin. The hit and some analysis from the commentators below.</p>

<p>Giroux of the Flyers on the other hand, the minute I saw the late hit on Zubrus I thought, Shanabanned for sure! Leading up to the play you could see Giroux was annoyed at the officials, some sources say it was on a play by Brodeur outside of the trapezoid, others say it was the clean hit by Fayne that may have set it off where Giroux thought it deserved more. All I saw was an angry and animated Giroux taking out his anger on the closest Devils player that had the puck (well had being the operative word). This is disgusting behaviour from any player in a professional sport! People get angry yes, people lash out yes, but to do it when you are in the game against someone who has nothing to do with things, when you know the risk of suspension is high and your team is facing elimination from the playoffs? Not a smart play. I thought Giroux wasn't mad from the typical Flyers mold, I now know I was gravely mistaken, with this play and also the whole breaking the stick over the goal posts in a loss to the Pens in Game 5 ...</p>

<p>This is not the first time Shanahan has suspended someone, and someone who is quite the influential player for a team, when that team is facing elimination. He did it with James Neal when he (Neal) really did some rather stupid plays, one of them against Giroux ironically. Really what Shanahan is showing here is that anger and retaliation has no place on the ice, going out and hitting someone illegally just to hurt them is not on when you are frustrated or angry! It really does show the wrong side of the sport to those youngsters who look up to these players!</p></section>
