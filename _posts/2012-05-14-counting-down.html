<p><section><p>Too many things this week!</p></p>

<p>First one is the count down to donning the hockey gear and getting on the ice to learn how to play ice hockey. This is going to be a most interesting experience! I've already expressed some apprehension as sometimes I feel like all left feet when on the ice, but I think this will ultimately make me a much better skater. Then again, speaking to the development coach (Matt) yesterday gave me a little insight to some of the things we will be doing. One such thing was to skate on one leg, and then bend that leg and straighten etc, this is to improve a) leg strength and b) balance. I thought to myself , gee I can't even do that while standing in sneakers, how am I going to do that on the ice, on skates! I tried it, and you know what, I could actually do it, on both legs I was quite shocked, but I tell you it does put some strain on your quads, but in a good way. So yesterday was spent trying a few things out, mucking around and then the best bit, getting the remainder of the hockey equipment to borrow for both Vicki and I. It was good to have everything, although the only pants they really had in my size were bright red and extremely heavy. I opted for a pair a little smaller to get me by, but I tell you what if I had of worn the other pants I think I'd be able to stand in front of a nuclear blast and not feel a thing on my thighs!</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be the day I go into Skatebiz and pick up our helmets, looking forward to that bit. I'll also be taking four pairs of skates in for sharpening, yes you heard me right: four! No we've not got a new member to the family or skating family, Vicki couldn't pass up a deal yesterday, a pair of near new Graf skates for $80, skates that retail for $200. They are in pretty good condition and Vicki will use them as her ice hockey skates as they are one size (Euro sizing) smaller than her current ones and fit that little bit snugger. I still want to get some new skates, but really cannot justify the $500+ for a new pair of skates that will last me a long time, now if I could sell my old ones I'd seriously think about it, mind you Vicki would kill me, seriously kill me, as in dead, I'm sure she'd stab me in the middle of the night with those $500 skates! So they can wait for a while, or I'll use my own money to buy them instead of dipping into the ice hockey funding.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Rangers and the Caps played game seven of their series, and the Rangers came out on top, not even an overtime game at that! That means that the Devils will now play the Rangers for the Conference finals, and the winner will head to the Stanley Cup finals. I am rooting for the Devils on this one, and really hope they keep up the level headedness they have shown during the last games against the Flyers. The Eastern Conference finals start today, and the first game between the Kings and the Coyotes is underway, I am not looking at the scores as I would like to watch the game without knowing the score (just for once). Everybody is saying the Kings are on fire, and are going to blitz the Coyotes, I think the Kings have peaked while the other teams have been on a downward spiral, but the Coyotes have also picked up their game as well. For me I want the Coyotes to advance and to knock the Kings off of their pedestal. We shall soon see in the next four to seven games who will come out on top.</p>

<p>Yesterday was also Mother's Day across the world, Braden and I let Vicki decide what she wanted to do and of course she picked ice skating, which neither of us mind at all. I gave Braden some money on Friday to visit the Mother's Day stall at school so he could pick out a present for Vicki. He ended up choosing a nice little jar of Vanilla Bath Salts, I am not sure how he realised she loved Vanilla, but he did well and Vicki was very happy with it. Braden and I got her a Devils jersey for Mother's Day, although it was supposed to be for her Birthday! It was customised with her favourite player, Zach Parise, and she absolutely loves it, she wore it skating yesterday and was very proud of it.</p></section>
