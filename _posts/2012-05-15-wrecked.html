<p><section><p>And it is only Tuesday.</p></p>

<p>Strange I know, but for some reason I've not been sleeping well of late, I think my brain is just still too active, thinking and thinking. It happens when work is busy and I have a few 'interesting' cases, unfortunately I'm one of those people that keep thinking about things as I tend to have a few <em>lightbulb</em> moments out of work hours.</p>

<p>The other thing keeping me up last night was making sure I woke up early enough to go and fill up my car with petrol/gas and get ready to take Braden to school and head into the office. Yes there was an ulterior motive, I went into town to pick up the helmets for Vicki and myself and also get all of our skates sharpened. It was great to have a chat to Kirk, although he was very busy unfortunately as he was down a couple of guys today. I hope his day raced by though. Vicki has a shiny new black Easton helmet with a full face cage and I have a mostly shiny new white Easton helmet with a visor. I just couldn't live with the full cage as the padded chin strap kept digging into my adams apple. They are all sized up correctly now and we are ready to start training on Thursday. Although we still need to learn how to get dressed properly.</p>

<p>There really isn't any other news of worth at the moment, we are all pretty quiet at home and even skipped the cheap skate night tonight as we are all feeling rather tired and a little run down.</p></section>
