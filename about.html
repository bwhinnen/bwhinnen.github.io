<p><section><p>These pages are the home of the Whinnen’s on the Interweb. At the moment they represent only a small clan of Whinnen’s based in San Diego, United States; previously Brisbane, Australia. That is Brett, Vicki and Braden, we hope this will change over time and we can get more Whinnen’s together in the one area.</p></p>

<p>Primarily the blog is a reflection of day to day activity of our small clan through the eyes of Brett. Every now and then the subject may branch off onto a tangent of the current topic point just as Brett’s mind moves from subject matter to subject matter in the search of knowledge and fun. Brett is an I.T. nerd/geek/dork who has worked in the industry for over 20 years in many different streams, he currently works for a large multi-national storage company as part of the Global Support Centre arm as a Level 3 Performance Specialist. While his work is technology based he has many different skills and hobbies outside of the stereotypical nerd/geek/dork idiom.</p>

<p>Through a great deal of work (not by us, although Brett has followed the paths through the Parish records, to learn how to do it and further the research if possible) the family name has been traced back to Cornwall in the UK, where we were a family of Miners and Blacksmiths. The Whinnen family name has been traced back as far as 1634 in the area around Breage in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Now that Braden is getting older we’ve decided that having a record of the family’s activities as a living memory would be a good idea given how hard it has been to find anything out about the history of the family and its origins. It will even give him a chance to add his commentary as he lives life and has fun.</p>

<p>If there are any other Whinnen’s out there who would like to become a part of this collaboration please don’t hesitate to contact us.</p></section>
