<p><section><h1>Contact</h1></p>

<p>For those who feel so inclined to contact me via the blog you can use the form below.</p>

<p>I do not use Face Book anymore so there is no point searching for me over there. I do use <a title="Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116999834209553761250" target="_blank">Google+</a> every now and then so you may find me there.</p>

<p>I read a great deal of tweets on <a title="twitter" href="http://twitter.com/@bwhinnen" target="_blank">twitter</a>, I do not tweet much anymore, but you can also find me on there.</p>
