One thing we noted the first time we went to the USA was the size of the portions ... they are HUGE ... especially when you consider the average cost of most dishes is between 20 - 40% cheaper in the USA when compared to Australia, yeah ok you pay between a 15 - 20% tip in the USA, but comparing the size, there is a huge value for money. Also consider that on average you pay around $3 for a soda in a glass at a restaurant in the USA, at most places this is also a bottomless soda, that is all refills are on the house, go figure. Now consider that the size of the soda you receive in the USA is well worth the $3 price tag on its own unlike the Australian equivalent small sodas we pay anywhere up to $4 for.

Many people give them a bad review, but we've always had great service and terrific food there. Even when dining on my own back in San Diego a few years ago the servers were always friendly and willing to strike up a conversation. A little sweet-talking by a 7 year old boy to a server is enough to get his chocolate milk upgraded to a full size serving. Can you tell just how happy he was?

Chilis has a wide variety of food on the menu, classed by me as a Tex Mex style they do truly cater for most people. Personally I'm a burger fan, I love burgers and I really love how Americans have made it into such a great meal with so many variations most Australian restaurants would cringe at, Chilis have a few different styles, all of which are fantastic. Yes I have had all of them on the menu too (no, not all in one sitting!). Other people may like to try the ribs, enchiladas, quesadillas, sandwiches, wings, steaks, crispers / tenders and so many other little items, they are all cooked consistently well and the taste is good, not bland and not overly spicy or rich to cater for a wide audience. Pricing is also excellent and service really is fantastic with your drink often being refilled when still half full!
