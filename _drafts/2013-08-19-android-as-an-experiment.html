title: Android as an experiment
summary: After a thorough investment in the Apple ecosystem I decided to give Android a go. Will it fit in with my current Apple product set and the way I do things?
oneliner: Will Android be able to run with an entire ecosystem that is Apple based?

<p><section><p>Over the last few years I have invested in the Apple ecosystem with iPhones, iPads, MacBook Airs, iMacs, Mac Pros (well what they call a Hackintosh) as well as Apple TVs and Apple networking equipment. With the advent of the iCloud I have also moved our calendars and contacts there as well. The only thing that has remained elsewhere has been the email, which I still host on my own virtual server using a combination of postfix, Zarafa and z-push to get push connectivity to all devices.</p></p>

<p>Having used the iPhone since the 3G days I have become complacent with the iOS offering on the phone, I do not really use my phone to play games, that is what the iPad is for so the phone is really a device to send and receive calls, messages (via iMessages), take simple photos, check Facebook, Twitter, Google+, email, maps and the like. After previewing iOS 7 betas on my iPhone 4 and avidly following the various forum and blog posts on it being run on the iPhone 5 I decided that the lack of real change was something I desperately wanted. I do agree that iOS is a great platform, but as a tinkerer I wanted something much different and the similarities between the underlying usage of iOS (which is a great advantage) was something that had become stale to me. Not to mention the leaked images of the new iPhone point to the same form factor as the current iPhone 5.</p>

<p><h3>Android devices ...</h3></p>
<p>(for those that hate ellipses please disregard the blatant usage of them above)</p>

<p>There are a plethora of Android devices out there, so many in fact that I don't know how someone would choose one. Apple on the other hand generally has one flagship available in various internal storage sizes and two colours, quite simple and easy! With Android you have (in no specific order) Samsung, HTC, Sony, Huawei, LG and Motorola to name a few, of these each of the manufacturers have various versions and models which really adds up quickly. Of course there are then the flagship models to take into account and of these there really are only two or three that make the cut in my opinion. They are the Samsung Galaxy S4, the HTC One and the LG Nexus 4. The only real problem with the last phone is that it is not an LTE phone and you have to buy it outright and it is a little dated now with a new model imminent. I discounted phones such as the Galaxy Note II as they are just too damned big and such a massive difference from the iPhone 4 I use now.</p>

<p><h3>Build quality, materials and button placement</h3></p>

<p>Really this does come down to a personal preference, but overall there are two major differences between the three phones listed above. Both the Samsung and the Nexus are polycarbonate phones, that is a fancy pants term for plastic, of course it is very durable plastic and can be made with a variety of surface textures whilst the HTC One is aluminium wheel with polycarbonate for antenna penetration. The build quality varies on each as the HTC is milled from a single piece of aluminium and then everything is miraculously inserted inside, this means no removable battery but does promise a much tighter overall fit and finish. The Nexus also has no removable battery and this also makes it a very well put together phone. The Samsung on the other hand has a removable battery and thus the back is removable as well, this can be seen as both a plus and a minus. A plus due to being able to replace the battery and also change the back shell to something else, a minus due to the often poor fit these shells give and the ease of breaking clips.</p>

<p>All three phones also employ vastly different button placement and usage. Starting with the Nexus it has a power button, volume buttons and then three typical on-screen buttons employed by Android. The Samsung has the same, power button, volume buttons and also a "home" button, as well as two capacitive buttons for back and menu. The HTC one is the odd one out here, with the same power and volume buttons, but only two capacitive buttons, one for back and the other for home, thus no menu button at all. To new Android users this really makes no difference but to existing users this can make a big difference in the way they use the device.</p>

<p><h3>Android version manufacturer skins</h3></p>

<p>What are skins? Skins are the manufacturers way of presenting Android and offering up a different user experience and often their own versions of base applications such as the phone dialler, messaging, contacts, calendar, browser and so forth. For Samsung there is Touchwiz, which allows many different ways of controlling the phone such as gestures, swipes and many others (I must admit I don't know them all). HTC uses Sense, a more slimline and less obtrusive version than Samsung and Touchwiz, but still has its own default applications, two primary examples are Blinkfeed a social feed for the home screen and Zoe a short 3 second video recording to facilitate capturing your day in short clips a little more than just a single snapshot. The Nexus on the other hand offers the vanilla Android experience, as Google intended it to be, no whiz-bangs or special applications, just pure Google simplicity.</p>

<p>For me this is what I was really after the vanilla approach, so I could then dictate what I wanted via different launchers or applications rather than being stuck with a manufacturers interpretation of what Android should be. The other reason being that Google updates its own version much quicker than the manufacturer and indeed the individual carriers (as they also have to approve and add their own software). This really narrowed it down to the Nexus for me, until something marvellous happened!</p>

<p><strong>Google announced that they were going to release a Google Play Edition of the Samsung S4 and the HTC One!</strong> This was fantastic news, and it meant that you would be able to purchase (only in the US) a version of these two great handsets and have the vanilla experience! Of course it didn't take long for the community to rip these apart and create flash able ROMs to turn any S4 or HTC One into a virtual Google Play Edition. Now the HTC One had more luck in that it could to all intents and purposes be a Google Play Edition handset regardless of how it started life (well with the exception of Sprint devices) and retain local LTE hardware compatibility. The Samsung could have a ROM installed that gave the Google Play Edition, but it was not a complete conversion and able to receive any OTA (over the air) updates like the HTC One. Not a major problem really as you still received the great vanilla Android experience and were able to update to any newer version generally within hours to a day after Google and the manufacturer released the new version (such as the recent update to Android 4.3).</p>

<p>Looking at the other offerings in the market place showed the ever present Android, which was up to 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and Windows Phones which was up to WP8. Being anti-Microsoft for many years now and not really liking the way that WP7 and WP8 worked or looked really made me shy away from those phones. Android on the other hand looked interesting, but all of the manufacturers had their own customisations and way they presented Android this was a little annoying coming from the Apple ecosystem where everything was well the same, so you in effect had an even playing field. One thing that Android based handsets lacked was a decent design. Polycarbonate may be all well and good and strong, but I really didn't like the feel of it after coming from the iPhone, especially the 4. Then I saw the HTC One, nice looking phone, felt nice in the hand, a flagship model, and the only serious contender for me was the Samsung Galaxy S4 (polycarbonate aside).</p>

<p>Of course this brought about the whole Sense (HTC) and Touchwiz (Samsung) debate, which was closer to the original Google version of Android, which was better to use day to day. Then I started reading that</p></section>
