<p><section><p>The last update was all about migrating the blog to a new process, that seems like it was so long ago. Honestly I had to re-learn how to do it all and I've updated my computer since then. Lucky everything is on github!</p></p>

<p>We all went on our great vacation to the USA, this was an East Coast trip. Specifically flying from Brisbane to Honolulu, then onto New York City. From there we drove accross New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to get to Pittsburgh! What a trip that was. I can tell you I was dead tired at the end of it, 10 hours + 10 hours + another 8 hours driving not to mention the 8 hour lay-over in Honolulu.</p>

<p>We based in PGH and then spent time exploring and travelling about, I'll detail that in another upcoming post. Suffice it to say it was a glorious 3 weeks where we travelled through six states and one Canadian province.</p>

<p>Prior to doing this I had a work trip to Sydney where I approached my manager to let him know I was interested in moving to the US for work. He seemed positive about it and got the ball rolling. Now I didn't realise that much had happened on this so blissfully went about the vacation and had a wonderful time. Racking up some awesome debt too!</p>

<p>When we got back we found out that things had progressed and that I needed to fill in a <i>heap</i> of paperwork and then we would need to go to Sydney to visit the Consulate General to petition our (well my) case for entering the USA for work purposes.</p>

<p>The amount of paperwork was astounding, 3lbs of paperwork came from the Immigration Lawyers in the USA and we made our appointments and booked our flights to Sydney. We made it some fun for Braden by going a day early and visiting Taronga Park Zoo. It was a bit brisk down there but we had a great time. The appointment itself, well we arrived early and went through the security and setup which was interesting in its own right. We then got to go to the interview area where some extra money was paid for the recipricated visa costs and anti-fraud charges and then the interview. I think the interview took all of 5 - 10 minutes and we had our visa!</p>

<p>Well that was easy (expensive and time consuming but easy). Then it sunk in, we were picking up and moving not across the country but across the world! We had just 4 weeks to get everything sorted and ourselves over to ... wait for it ... San Diego, California! Not our first choice but definitely not a problem. Beautiful weather, friendly people and a great place overall!</p>

<p>We decided that we'd fly over the same way as last time, use Hawaiian Airlines and go via Honolulu. A nice easy flight (relative to the last one). Organizing the move of our possessions was harder; not from finding who to move it, but what to move and what to sell and what to store. We ended up selling all of our electronics bar my computer and Vicki's iMac. All of the large furniture was also sold. The cars were the hardest part. Vicki's took about 3 months to sell and mine, well that is still sitting at our friends place awaiting for someone to come along and give it a new home!</p>

<p>The next step was getting the house ready and also finding a tennant. Luckily we had a few pamphlets </p>

<p>Looking at the other offerings in the market place showed the ever present Android, which was up to 4.1.2 and 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and Windows Phones which was up to WP8. Being anti-Microsoft for many years now and not really liking the way that WP7 and WP8 worked or looked really made me shy away from those phones. Android on the other hand looked interesting, but all of the manufacturers had their own customisations and way they presented Android this was a little annoying coming from the Apple ecosystem where everything was well the same, so you in effect had an even playing field. One thing that Android based handsets lacked was a decent design. Polycarbonate may be all well and good and strong, but I really didn't like the feel of it after coming from the iPhone, especially the 4. Then I saw the HTC One, nice looking phone, felt nice in the hand, a flagship model, and the only serious contender for me was the Samsung Galaxy S4 (polycarbonate aside).</p>

<p>Of course this brought about the whole Sense (HTC) and Touchwiz (Samsung) debate, which was closer to the original Google version of Android, which was better to use day to day. Then I started reading that</p></section>
