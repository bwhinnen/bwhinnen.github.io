  <p><section><p>What is going on here? Brett suddenly posting again? Yes! I've been lazy far too long now, I blame a distinct lack of motivation and pressure of trying to think of a new subject everyday. To me that smacks of a lack of commitment more than anything but I'll stick with my lazy excuse.</p></p>

<p>So the Devils made the Stanley Cup playoffs, they lost unfortunately, I would have loved to see them win, and given Parise's move to Minnesota it would have been a great ending to his Devils career. I also think that Brodeur would have retired if they won the cup, mind you I am happy to see both him and Johan back in the line up for next year.</p>

<p>I'm still a little shocked that Staal decided that he wanted to move, I can't blame him when looking at it from a perspective of the number of top line players the Pens have and of course the chance to play with his brother and all, but come on I really liked the dynamics of the Pens last season. Mind you I cannot wait for the new season to see just how they go, mind you I still think they should have traded Martin rather than Michalek, but who am I?</p>

<p>The Red Sox have been playing luke warm, more colder than hot. The Pirates on the other hand have been playing amazingly, it must be the awesomeness of Zoltan!</p>

<p>We've been doing pretty much the same around here, ice skating, ice hockey and all. Both Vicki and Braden have celebrated their birthdays in the last week. Vicki was sick for hers which meant we didn't do a great deal, but Braden and I still took her out to dinner to celebrate. Braden spent the day at the ice rink,no party, just a nice cake amongst friends and family, he was quite chuffed when he got to kiss Steph (his 'older' girlfriend) on the cheek.</p></section>
