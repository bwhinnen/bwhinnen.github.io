  <p><section><p>And all kinds! We had another training session on Thursday night just gone. It really is a great deal of fun and I am starting to feel better skating around with a stick now, which is good. This was my second training session and Vicki's third as she got to train with the women's team last weekend. She is still a much better skater than me, and probably will be for a long time, but I tend to be a bit better at the things that require strength, such as jumping etc, and that is not surprising, but it is only a matter of time before her skills take over Â on that, so give me my short lived something better than her! Not that it makes all that much difference in the long term though, as long as we all have fun.</p></p>

<p>Braden also joined us for most of the training session as the juniors were doing some advanced work and there was no one else his age or skill level there. I think he got a little bored with us, but still did what he was told which is always good, I made one of the last things we did a game for him which helped.</p>

<p>I can't speak for Vicki but having all the gear on is giving me some confidence, I am doing things that I would not normally do without it on, that is a good thing as it is also translating across to skating without gear. Why? Because I realise I can do it without falling over and then continue to do it without the gear, which only advances my skating further. As an example this morning was skate school and I was much more confident with my outside edge drills and feel a little more in control of what I am doing, especially when the edge starts to slip because I am not placing enough weight on the edge.</p>

<p>Today has been a great day for relaxing at home, we've watched the last three games of the Devils versus Rangers Eastern Conference Finals even though we already know the scores and outcome. It has been good watching, although seeing in person just how often the Devils lost a commanding lead was a little scary.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be a day of just relaxing skating, although I'll be trying to improve some newly learnt skills and really should be doing more backwards and transition practice. We will see, I am also in two minds on wearing my shin pads / hockey pants combination on the ice, but think I might just use these sessions for basic training and fun to ensure that I still keep the enjoyment of just skating around.</p></section>
