    <h3>Late night hockey practice makes for a new mouthguard.</h3>
  </header>

  <p><section><p>Yes I should of posted yesterday, but we did not get home until almost 10pm after hockey practice and then by the time I'd finished hanging up the hockey gear to air out overnight and a shower it was 11pm! So suffice it to say I didn't have any time to post last night after hockey and today, what a day , it was shocking to say the least, busy, busy and then busy, just in case you didn't figure it out today was a busy day!</p></p>

<p>Back to hockey practice, in a word, AWESOME! We had such a great time and the hour really did go far too quickly, I think we spent almost as much time getting ready when you consider I had to dress Braden and then myself as well as undress us both after training finished. I've said it to friends, I have never felt so uncoordinated in my life, well with the exception of trying to ball-room dance just prior to getting married to Vicki. But I digress, it is hard enough to skate, then to add the hockey gear adds a little more difficulty, but trying to control a stick, and a puck while moving!! Holy crap that was difficult. I think I need some practice in just skating with a stick to get used to the movements and where the stick should be at each stage of the stride.</p>

<p>I think I worked harder than I have for a while in that training session, you are in 8 - 10 degree air, on a frozen pool of water and yet I still had sweat dripping from my face and nose! It was so difficult to do what was asked of us, but I tried to do everything and did as well as I could, I was having such a great time that I didn't even think about it, well much. Even wearing all that gear I was still a little apprehensive about forwards to backwards transitions but the stick did help to balance when I messed up.</p>

<p>Vicki seemed in her element, but I think she had some issues controlling her stick as well. At least she said did, and I think she did pretty well all things considering. I do know she had a few troubles with how to angle the stick on turns, but she got the hang of it towards the end. I think that was the easy bit for me, turns seemed to be quite easy, but the rest wasn't so easy, I think it was the opposite for Vicki.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for next Thursday though, to do it all again!</p>

<p>Of course Braden was his usual forgetful self at the end of the session. Which is nothing bad, honestly, it was 9pm and he'd spent the last hour racing around so he was tired. He packed his own bag just prior to leaving, and of course left a few things ... Lets see, he left his cup, his pants, that was the first time. Then he came back for his shin pads and one of his gloves ... well I thought we had everything until we got home. Somewhere along the way he lost his mouthguard. For some reason typing that gives me déjà vu, it reminds me of a dream I had, or should I say recall.</p>

<p>So this morning before work I had to go and get him a new one this morning, with every intention of getting him a nice Shock Doctor gel nano that Id seen when looking for something for me. I then saw something a little smaller on the shelf below, and thought that would be much better than the one he had. We ended up boiling it and sizing it for him tonight and wow, what a great fit. So much better than the other one he had, I think he will like this one much better, lets just hope it lasts a little longer!</p>

<p>He is a very happy camper at the moment though, although he is in bed, his Grandma is here for the weekend, and of course he rarely sees her, so it is great for both him and his Grandma! I know he will want to show off to her when she watches him ice skate tomorrow and then again for hockey practice on Sunday morning.</p></section>
