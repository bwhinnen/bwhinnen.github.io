    <h3>That movie is sooo OLD Dad! Words from a six year old about Beverly Hills Cop!</h3>
  </header>

  <p><section><p>Not really old movies but old movies for a six year old like Braden ... last night after getting back from ice skating we decided to watch some Beverly Hills Cop. Why I hear you ask? Simply because on the way to skate school on Saturday Axel F was playing on the stereo (yes I have some old music on my USB stick), and of course Braden knows this from Monsters V Aliens, but Vicki and I know it from Beverly Hills Cop! Off I went to get a copy of it, no small feat I must say where most of the older movies at the video store only have one copy of a well used DVD. I ended up getting all three movies for a weekly hire, I also grabbed Aladdin for Braden as I thought he might enjoy it, I know I did when I first saw it.</p></p>

<p>While watching Beverly Hills Cop, the original one, it really surprised me at how badly choreographed the fight scenes were. I mean the punches and elbows never even came close to connecting with the other person, seriously I never noticed that when I was 14 - 15? Is it that I am now older I have become more analytical of these movies, or is it simply that the newer well choreographed movies have raised the bar so? It makes me wonder what Braden thinks of some of the older movies like Star Trek, Star Wars that he has seen, when comparing them to the effects of movies such as Transformers, Avatar etc. I know he is six, but still he must notice the difference!</p>

<p>All in all though watching the two Beverly Hills Cop movies last night really was a trip back down memory lane, back when Eddie Murphy was really doing some of his good work, I think I'll have to go and find Coming to America next, another movie that I remember from my youth that had some great Eddie Murphy antics. Sometimes it is great to go back and re-watch those older movies you loved as a youngster, but on the flip-side, sometimes it is a big mistake to go back and realise just how corny or bad they really were and wonder at just where in life you were at the time!</p>

<p>This morning being a public holiday in Brisbane, for some, as I still have to work today, Braden is sitting watching Aladdin, he seems to be having a ball, I have heard the movie rewinded a few times already to re-play some bit he finds funny. I have also heard quite a few laughs and giggles coming from the lounge room as well. It really does make me smile knowing that he gets as much enjoyment as I did out of watching a movie that is so old, this exemplifies just how well Disney Studios did with their movies, they really are ageless.</p></section>
