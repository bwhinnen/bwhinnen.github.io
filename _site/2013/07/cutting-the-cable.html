    <h1>Cutting the cable</h1>
    <h3>Getting rid of cable TV is a blast.</h3>
  </header>

  <p><section><p>I (and I guess we) have had cable TV for a number of years, who am I kidding, we had it before moving to Brisbane, and that was almost 10 years ago now. As of yesterday I finally got around to cutting the cable fully. We dropped off of the $100+ Foxtel package in 2011 as we weren't really watching it and were disappointed with the amount (well lack of) NHL and MLB coverage that it had to warrant the sports channels. It really did make more sense to upgrade the internet to a 500GB package in order to take advantage of the NHL and MLB apps on the AppleTV than to be limited to the paltry three to four games a week, often of teams we weren't interested in.</p></p>

<p>I tried to cancel back then but got talked into keeping the IQ2 box and paying $10 a month to keep the free to air channels. This made sense as we didn't have any aerial to be able to get free to air over the actual air. And the $10 a month wasn't all that bad in reality. Fast forward to 2013, and I can count the number of times that we've had the IQ2 box turned on to watch free to air TV on, well, one finger. Yes a thorough waste of $10 a month over the last 18months or so.</p>

<p>We've had a media PC or HTPC as they are called for a number of years now as well, from the days of us having a CRT TV still to be exact. It used to run Windows Media Centre and MediaBrowser on Vista and then Windows 7 before I finally discovered and configured up XBMC. From there I moved to a wonderful system called OpenELEC which is a simple very cut down Linux distribution that ONLY runs XBMC. A very small footprint that boots very quickly and with the release of XBMC 12 (Frodo) supports full HD video and audio formats which is fantastic and had everything needed.</p>

<p>As XBMC Frodo fully supports PVR capabilities I have often thought of toying with Live TV but not having an aerial has held me back. Some research while I was bored showed that we had direct line of sight to the transmission tower, just a mere 19.2km away. Here I thought the tower was on the other side of the hill we live on, but no there it is toying with me. I could of course spend several hundred (around $300) to have an external aerial installed and all the cabling done, but I'm a cheapskate and only need one location wired in. I started looking at internal aerials and what they could achieve, it seems that a familiar "cheap" brand, Crest made an internal 42dB aerial with amplifier and Office Works had it on clearance for $80. Nice! Then I needed a TV tuner, well I had this old Dell laptop laying about that was doing nothing (we are pretty much an Apple household now), so I looked at cheap (this was only going to be a POC you understand) USB tuner. Office Works comes to the rescue again, with a USB 2.0 single tuner from Leadtek that I know works with both OpenELEC and MythTV.</p>

<p>I then downloaded mythbuntu (I'm lazy and didn't want to have to install ubuntu and then get all the relevant packages to create a MythTV backend server), installed it on the laptop and started configuring. It took me a couple of hours but I had things tuned in and kind of running, then started on the EPG data (essential for recording and nice to see what is on TV) before mucking about with the front end. A long story short I had TV on the various HTPCs around the house by the evening, I was pretty chuffed, Vicki was kind of ho-hum, but hey what floats my boat right?</p>

<p>The next morning I noted that all of the Channel 7 stations were, well, crap, so I decided to move the aerial up into the ceiling space, that was fun, but in the end I had it moved, the laptop moved to a better position mounted on the wall (I use VNC to control it) and used an existing hole in the wall to feed the aerial and power cables through. Wonderful I thought, yes right, the Channel 7 stations were still horrific! I then did some searching for fine tuning capabilities and so forth and found many people having issues with Channel 7. Solutions included fine tuning, new cables, and re-scanning for the station. I chose the later, especially now the aerial was in the right spot, pointed in the right direction and had no big metal garage doors in the line of sight!</p>

<p>That was the correct decision it turns out, all stations were lovely and reception was great. Then came cleaning up the stations presented to the HTPC and downloading the channel icons, the later not essential, but looks good :)<p>

<p>Once that was all done I called Foxtel and cancelled my account fully, not before they once again tried to talk me into staying with great discounted rates! No, No, NO! I just wanted out. We don't watch free to air TV very much, well at all, but having it there for visitors is always handy, especially the 'rents and older generations who like to watch the News and other Current Affairs type programs. All of our media has been made available digitally on a NAS, so we have all our DVD's, BluRays and CD's online all the time and thus don't really need to watch TV as we can easily wait to buy the relevant title and then re-encode for use with XBMC.</p></section>
