  <p><section><p>The last update was all about migrating the blog to a new process, that seems like it was so long ago. Honestly I had to re-learn how to do it all and I've updated my computer since then. Lucky everything is on github!</p></p>

<p>Where did I leave off? That is right we were planning  on a great East Coast vacation. East Coast? Yes the East Coast of the USA. We had such a great time, expensive, but great!</p>

<p>Before the trip, I had to go to Syndey to visit the head office in Australia. I approached my direct manager about the possibility of moving to the USA for work. He was very positive about it, but as with all things in the company I work for (and especially work VISAs) these things take time so I put it out of my mind as we planned and went on our vacation.</p>

<p>The initial part of the trip was the hardest, 10 hours from Brisbane to Honolulu, a seven hour layover, then another 10 hours from Honolulu to New York City. That was just the beginning though, then there was the 8 hour drive from New York City to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The three week vacation took us through six states and two (well three including Australia) countries. It was such a good time and we all had a blast. I fell in love with Pittsburgh. This from my own perspective rather than seeing it through the eyes of people that live there.</p>

<p>After arriving back in the country we found out that things had progressed and that I needed to fill in a <i>heap</i> of paperwork and then we would need to go to Sydney to visit the Consulate General to petition our (well my) case for entering the USA for work purposes.</p>

<p>The amount of paperwork was astounding, 3lbs of paperwork came from the Immigration Lawyers in the USA and we made our appointments and booked our flights to Sydney. We made it some fun for Braden by going a day early and visiting Taronga Park Zoo. It was a bit brisk down there but we had a great time. The appointment itself, well we arrived early and went through the security and setup which was interesting in its own right. We then got to go to the interview area where some extra money was paid for the recipricated visa costs and anti-fraud charges and then the interview. I think the interview took all of 5 - 10 minutes and we had our visa!</p>

<p>Well that was easy (expensive and time consuming but easy). Then it sunk in, we were picking up and moving not across the country but across the world! We had just 4 weeks to get everything sorted and ourselves over to ... wait for it ... San Diego, California! Not our first choice but definitely not a problem. Beautiful weather, friendly people and a great place overall!</p>

<p>We decided that we'd fly over the same way as last time, use Hawaiian Airlines and go via Honolulu. A nice easy flight (relative to the last one). Organizing the move of our possessions was harder; not from finding who to move it, but what to move and what to sell and what to store. We ended up selling all of our electronics bar my computer and Vicki's iMac. All of the large furniture was also sold. The cars were the hardest part. Vicki's took about 3 months to sell and mine took a further 3 months!</p>

<p>The next step was getting the house ready and also finding a tennant. Luckily we had a few pamphlets for painters and such which made things a bit easier. In the end we had the house re-painted (almost all of it). The yeard cleaned up and the place ready for a new family to move in. The house was empty for around four weeks before a great couple moved in to call it home.</p>

<p>Our flight over was easy, just as we thought it would be. Immigration took longer than we expected this time though, but in the end we had the stamps in place and were legal aliens within the USA! We arrived in San Diego at around 10PM, transferred to the hotel which was to become our home for the next few weeks</p>

<p>Friday was a busy day with picking up the hire car, visiting the Credit Union to get our debit cards, finalize the opening of our first USA account and visiting the office and meeting my new colleagues and bosses.</p>

<p>Everyone was great, but the thing that resonated the most was how difficult it was going to be to find a place to live. That and the fact that we no longer had any credit history what-so-ever! Suffice it to say we looked at about four different appartment (well condos in reality) complexes and found one we liked. This was on Saturday (yes the second day after arriving), we signed a lease on that day and because I'd been with the company for 10+ years the security deposit was the same as it would be for any US person with good credit! We were to move in the following Tuesday! Amazing!</p>

<p>I can say now that waiting to move over after completing 10 years with my company was a good idea. The long service leave I had saved up, really helped to pay for the move, the furnishing of our new place and generally restricting just how much we had to dip into our savings.</p>

<p>The next step in our adventure was to get our own car. While the hire car was good, it was not ours and cost considerably more than we wanted to spend indefinitely. Having no credit history is just as bad as having a bad one we found out. We looked at a new car, just $30,000 (cheap by Australian costs) but with our lack of credit the dealer wanted $25,000 down and then a 20% load over the next 60 months! Ha, you've got to be kidding! We ended up buying a second hand Mercedes ML350 (9 years and 120,000 miles old) for cash and that did us well for almost 12 months.</p>

<p>We got Braden enrolled in school, which was easy and we were set. Thus began our new life for the next 3 - 5 years! I'll continue with some of our adventures over the next few weeks.</p></section>
