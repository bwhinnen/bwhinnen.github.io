    <h3>My thoughts on depressions representation in the media.</h3>
  </header>

  <p><section><p>Chances are you know someone that suffers from this very serious illness. You may even be one of those afflicted. <em>Of course you've heard it all</em>, the media is so up to date on the subject everyone should be an expert by now.</p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, yes, that was sarcasm. The media tends to jump on several key issues and does a half assed job of it. Objectivity in journalism has almost gone the way of the dodo; almost, some still value their integrity, but most seem to tout the corporate media line. What this has to do with depression is quite simple, the media tends to report lovely flowery, uplifting and of course successful stories. In fact depression is far from this, even when one is cured there are no fan-fares and to be honest is there truly a complete cure for this illness?</p>

<p>Personally as a long time sufferer, I'd have to say no, there is no complete cure, there are degrees of management. A great day can turn bad so very easily and this can spiral into a darkness that is difficult to navigate out of. Support is something that is a big part of managing this illness, and by that I mean the support you give anyone, not something specific to what you believe should be given to someone who is depressed.</p>

<p>Everything will work out? Is that so, for many that is just not true. Things don't just work themselves out, people don't just snap their fingers and feel at one with the universe. In itself that is naught but a fallacy, potentially a sign of denial or even deeper concerns in an individual. Depression requires mental strength and clarity, things that are hard to muster when depression is rampant. Strength is sapped by the constant darkness that engulfs you, with that comes exhaustion and a dulling of cognitive clarity. Depressed people are often very tired for the simple fact that they are mentally drained. I'm not suggesting that mental fitness is a solution, by no means; however, it does help to stave off some deeper darker moments.</p>

<p>Some medications can also give an edge, an ever so slight advantage. I like to call it breathing room, or an enforced “count to 10” moment. It can allow people a small reprieve a break from that constant mental struggle. By no means do I advocate that people get stuck on large doses of drugs, for that is what they are, to combat depression,. At lower doses it can definitely act as a viable management strategy. This is different for all people and the level also differs. Why? Simply because everyone has a different trigger point, differing levels of support, differing environments! That is right we are all different, while the end results and many symptoms may be the same we all suffer for different reasons. In entire honesty the reasons may not seem all that large to you, but to those who suffer they are inexplicably huge!</p>

<p>The only way I can see to reduce a small part of this struggle is for realism in the media. The media and those that control it need to understand that depression is not just a flowery result. It is a personal struggle, no, a battle, for your own emotions. It is dark, it is dangerous and it is most often something faced alone. With this realization there will be better support for those who suffer. Dare I say a better public understanding and acceptance for those sufferers of this illness.</p>

<p>While we cannot necessarily cure depression, we can help all of those that suffer. Understand it is an ongoing war fought on many fronts with different battles, skirmishes, wins and unfortunately losses. With this understanding give support for those that are fighting, support that they need, not the support we think they need! Be there. Listen. Help by simply, but genuinely asking if they are OK. Above all being supportive with sincerity!</p>

<p>I have no idea why I wrote this, I had no aim in such a piece, yet writing these thoughts out has given me a way of expressing myself that I find I cannot easily do so, even to those closest to me.</p></section>
