>>>>>>> 798c8fb340fd7a6afe65123cf33e4638a497505d

<p>Unfortunately, yes, that was sarcasm. The media tends to jump on several <em>key</em> issues and does a half assed job of it. Objectivity in journalism has almost gone the way of the dodo; almost, some still value their integrity, but most seem to tout the corporate media line. What this has to do with depression is quite simple, the media tends to report lovely flowery, uplifting and of course successful stories. In fact depression is far from this, even when one is <em>cured</em> there are no fan-fares and to be honest is there truly a complete cure for this illness?</p>

<p>Personally as a long time sufferer, I'd have to say no, there is no complete cure, there are degrees of management. A great day can turn bad so very easily and this can spiral into a darkness that is difficult to navigate out of. Support is something that is a big part of managing this illness, and by that I mean the support you give anyone, not something specific to what you believe should be given to someone who is depressed.</p>

<p><em>Everything will work out?</em> Is that so, for many that is just not true. Things don't just work themselves out, people don't just snap their fingers and feel at one with the universe. In itself that is naught but a fallacy, potentially a sign of denial or even deeper concerns in an individual. Depression requires mental strength and clarity, things that are hard to muster when depression is rampant. Strength is sapped by the constant darkness that engulfs you, with that comes exhaustion and a dulling of cognitive clarity. Depressed people are often very tired for the simple fact that they are mentally drained. I'm not suggesting that mental fitness is a solution, by no means; however, it does help to stave off some deeper darker moments.</p>

<p>Some medications can also give an edge, an ever so slight advantage. I like to call it breathing room, or an enforced “count to 10” moment. It can allow people a small reprieve a break from that constant mental struggle. By no means do I advocate that people get stuck on large doses of drugs, for that is what they are, to combat depression,. At lower doses it can definitely act as a viable management strategy. This is different for all people and the level also differs. Why? Simply because everyone has a different trigger point, differing levels of support, differing environments! That is right we are all different, while the end results and many symptoms may be the same we all suffer for different reasons. In entire honesty the reasons may not seem all that large to you, but to those who suffer they are inexplicably huge!</p>

<p>The only way I can see to reduce a small part of this struggle is for realism in the media. The media and those that control it need to understand that depression is not just a flowery result. It is a personal struggle, no, a battle, for your own emotions. It is dark, it is dangerous and it is most often something faced alone. With this realization there will be better support for those who suffer. Dare I say a better public understanding and acceptance for those sufferers of this illness.</p>

<p>While we cannot necessarily cure depression, we can help all of those that suffer. Understand it is an ongoing war fought on many fronts with different battles, skirmishes, wins and unfortunately losses. With this understanding give support for those that are fighting, support that they need, not the support we think they need! Be there. Listen. Help by simply, but genuinely asking if they are OK. Above all being supportive with sincerity!</p>

<p>I have no idea why I wrote this, I had no aim in such a piece, yet writing these thoughts out has given me a way of expressing myself that I find I cannot easily do so, even to those closest to me.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>My first real smartphone was an iPhone 3. I so wanted it and hung out for it and was so happy when I got it. It offered everything I needed at the time and I thought then and there I'd be an Apple fanboy (from a phone perspective) forever.</p></p>

<p>I moved to the iPhone 4 and had an iPhone 5S for work but wanted a taste of the dark side. Yes I wanted to try Android, but I didn't want to give up the quality build of the Apple devices, the polish of IOS ... I ended up getting a HTC One (M7) and fully converted to pure Android via the Google Play Edition release. I played around with customization, but it never really gave me anything extra that I desperately wanted. The same with widgets, they didn't do much for me. I did like being able to put App Icons anywhere on the desktop grid though, please Apple do that!</p>

<p>The one thing that I loved was when Google put much more emphasis into Google Now and released the GEL (Google Experience Launcher). This gave me some great nifty little notifications, the ease of being able to look at my cards, quick checks on weather, scores and news that interested me. Integration into other GAPPS (Google Apps) made it such a great tool.</p>

<p>The phone tells me where I parked (not that I forget very often), how long it will take to get home, when I should leave to make an appointment. The later is rather amusing at times as it will tell me at 8:00AM that I need to leave for work, even though I am sitting at my desk, and have been for over an hour! OK Google has improved to the point that it really rivals Siri, but with the added bonus of Google's power behind it. Siri has always led the way though, being first to have voice controls on being able to do tasks and so forth.</p>

<p>The biggest difference was the screen size, and Apple has improved that with the iPhone 6+ and now the iPhone 6S+. I can only imagine the 7 will be just as good. IOS has tended to stagnate a little. I still own an iPad (Air 2) and have kept up to date with IOS, while it has tended to stagnate a little in appearance it has improved in functionality quite well.</p>

<p>One thing Apple with iOS has really come ahead of Google with Android are the neat little hardware features. It was the first with finger print technology, and it is awesome. Haptic feedback and the ability to detect pressure on the screen is just outstanding and I wish that Android had done some of that as well.</p>

<p>All this does for me is make we want parts of both. The hardware of the Apple iPhone combined with some of the great iOS features and then to top it off some of the functionality of Android such as the GEL, integration into Google Now and the cards (without having to open another App). I know this won't happen, but I would like a tighter integration between the two, well specifically the Google Apps that I use rather than Android as a whole.</p>

<p>The other thing I love with Android is the integration of Google Voice and Hangouts with the default Dialer and SMS integration. That is I can use my Google Voice number without needing to use a different applicaiton. I like this as I use it to receive all calls (I don't give out my default T-mobile number to anyone). I also use Google voice to make calls, especially international ones as I can just use Google credit rather than an additional $10 a month on my T-mobile account.</p>

<p>I think that if this level of integration between, well lets be honest, Google and Apple takes off I would probably find myself back onto an iPhone.</p>

<p>Face it, underneath it all I am an Apple fan boy afterall. I just like to dabble with the dark side. Really all of my computers / tablets are all Apple, I even prefer to run Mac OS X at work rather than Windows and for the things I have to run on Windows I have a VM!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>The last update was all about migrating the blog to a new process, that seems like it was so long ago. Honestly I had to re-learn how to do it all and I've updated my computer since then. Lucky everything is on github!</p></p>

<p>Where did I leave off? That is right we were planning  on a great East Coast vacation. East Coast? Yes the East Coast of the USA. We had such a great time, expensive, but great!</p>

<p>Before the trip, I had to go to Syndey to visit the head office in Australia. I approached my direct manager about the possibility of moving to the USA for work. He was very positive about it, but as with all things in the company I work for (and especially work VISAs) these things take time so I put it out of my mind as we planned and went on our vacation.</p>

<p>The initial part of the trip was the hardest, 10 hours from Brisbane to Honolulu, a seven hour layover, then another 10 hours from Honolulu to New York City. That was just the beginning though, then there was the 8 hour drive from New York City to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The three week vacation took us through six states and two (well three including Australia) countries. It was such a good time and we all had a blast. I fell in love with Pittsburgh. This from my own perspective rather than seeing it through the eyes of people that live there.</p>

<p>After arriving back in the country we found out that things had progressed and that I needed to fill in a <i>heap</i> of paperwork and then we would need to go to Sydney to visit the Consulate General to petition our (well my) case for entering the USA for work purposes.</p>

<p>The amount of paperwork was astounding, 3lbs of paperwork came from the Immigration Lawyers in the USA and we made our appointments and booked our flights to Sydney. We made it some fun for Braden by going a day early and visiting Taronga Park Zoo. It was a bit brisk down there but we had a great time. The appointment itself, well we arrived early and went through the security and setup which was interesting in its own right. We then got to go to the interview area where some extra money was paid for the recipricated visa costs and anti-fraud charges and then the interview. I think the interview took all of 5 - 10 minutes and we had our visa!</p>

<p>Well that was easy (expensive and time consuming but easy). Then it sunk in, we were picking up and moving not across the country but across the world! We had just 4 weeks to get everything sorted and ourselves over to ... wait for it ... San Diego, California! Not our first choice but definitely not a problem. Beautiful weather, friendly people and a great place overall!</p>

<p>We decided that we'd fly over the same way as last time, use Hawaiian Airlines and go via Honolulu. A nice easy flight (relative to the last one). Organizing the move of our possessions was harder; not from finding who to move it, but what to move and what to sell and what to store. We ended up selling all of our electronics bar my computer and Vicki's iMac. All of the large furniture was also sold. The cars were the hardest part. Vicki's took about 3 months to sell and mine took a further 3 months!</p>

<p>The next step was getting the house ready and also finding a tennant. Luckily we had a few pamphlets for painters and such which made things a bit easier. In the end we had the house re-painted (almost all of it). The yeard cleaned up and the place ready for a new family to move in. The house was empty for around four weeks before a great couple moved in to call it home.</p>

<p>Our flight over was easy, just as we thought it would be. Immigration took longer than we expected this time though, but in the end we had the stamps in place and were legal aliens within the USA! We arrived in San Diego at around 10PM, transferred to the hotel which was to become our home for the next few weeks</p>

<p>Friday was a busy day with picking up the hire car, visiting the Credit Union to get our debit cards, finalize the opening of our first USA account and visiting the office and meeting my new colleagues and bosses.</p>

<p>Everyone was great, but the thing that resonated the most was how difficult it was going to be to find a place to live. That and the fact that we no longer had any credit history what-so-ever! Suffice it to say we looked at about four different appartment (well condos in reality) complexes and found one we liked. This was on Saturday (yes the second day after arriving), we signed a lease on that day and because I'd been with the company for 10+ years the security deposit was the same as it would be for any US person with good credit! We were to move in the following Tuesday! Amazing!</p>

<p>I can say now that waiting to move over after completing 10 years with my company was a good idea. The long service leave I had saved up, really helped to pay for the move, the furnishing of our new place and generally restricting just how much we had to dip into our savings.</p>

<p>The next step in our adventure was to get our own car. While the hire car was good, it was not ours and cost considerably more than we wanted to spend indefinitely. Having no credit history is just as bad as having a bad one we found out. We looked at a new car, just $30,000 (cheap by Australian costs) but with our lack of credit the dealer wanted $25,000 down and then a 20% load over the next 60 months! Ha, you've got to be kidding! We ended up buying a second hand Mercedes ML350 (9 years and 120,000 miles old) for cash and that did us well for almost 12 months.</p>

<p>We got Braden enrolled in school, which was easy and we were set. Thus began our new life for the next 3 - 5 years! I'll continue with some of our adventures over the next few weeks.</p></section>

So I started a search for some other way to use GAE (Google App Engine) to serve up simple static pages of html.</p></p>

<p>I have to say that there are some pretty clever folks out there. I first found some information about a little project called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="jekyll">jekyll</a> that will use a plain text file (or markdown if you prefer) into a website using templates and some other goodness. Jekyll is based on rubygems so it is pretty much available for everything. It also ties in very nicely with <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub, inc">GitHub, Inc</a> and even allows you to use a GitHub based url to serve up your pages.</p>

<p>Obviously that is not quite what I want as I really would like Google to be the final resting place for our online presence. Some further searching using a simple search term of</p>

<p class="notice">jekyll google app engine</p>

<p>Came up with a ready made python application called <a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com" title="DryDrop by binaryage">DryDrop</a> which allows you to autmatically update or cache pages from GitHub onto GAE simply by updating your GitHub repository. There were also some interesting pages to read on what people had done to achieve this.</p>

<p>Whilst playing around with it I soon realised that I would have to delve into css again, this is not really an issue but did prove to be interesting and I may post more on that later. One thing that is severely lacking in jekyll is the ability to have tags or categories displayed easily. After all using the liquid markup it is easy to put them into a post, but required some additional plugins to actually do anything with them.</p>

<p>I found a simple tag plugin from <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/" title="Tags In Jekyll">Charlie Park</a> that I adapted to also incorporate categories as well. Now this is not a "cloud" type of arrangement but simply gives me the ability to a) display the tags and categories on a post and b) actually have a page that lists all the posts that are in either the tag or category.</p>

      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'
      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'tag_index.html')
      self.data['tag'] = tag
      tag_title_prefix = site.config['tag_title_prefix'] || 'Posts Tagged &ldquo;'
      tag_title_suffix = site.config['tag_title_suffix'] || '&rdquo;'
      self.data['title'] = "#{tag_title_prefix}#{tag}#{tag_title_suffix}"
    end
  end
  class TagGenerator < Generator
    safe true
    def generate(site)
      if site.layouts.key? 'tag_index'
        dir = site.config['tag_dir'] || 'tag'
        site.tags.keys.each do |tag|
          write_tag_index(site, File.join(dir, tag), tag)
        end
      end
    end
    def write_tag_index(site, dir, tag)
      index = TagIndex.new(site, site.source, dir, tag)

      index.write(site.dest)
      site.pages << index

<p>To make this fit in with my basic pages I used the following as my <i>_layouts/tag_index.html</i>. This gives me the ability to show a page that matches fully in with my primary archves style page.</p>

<p>One thing that using GAE and GitHub is that it gives me great speeds, there are no database reads, pages are cached and as long as I configure GAE to always have one instance available I get great responses at all times. Of course using git means that I also have a hsitory of all the changes, enforced version control!</p>

<p>Overall this saves me around $130 - $180 a year for just a database and some cloud storage that quite honestly I don't use. It also gives me the ability to get my hands dirty again with coding, which I really do need.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>As you are all aware we are heading off on a trip to Pittsburgh for Christmas. We checked the last 6, SIX years of NHL schedules before deciding on dates and the Penguins were always home over the Christmas / New Year period.</p></p>

<p><strong>Well thank you NHL</strong>, but with the devision realignment the schedules all changed! So that means for the entire time we are in Pittsburgh the Pens are not at home! Thankfully they are playing a game in nearby Ohio and then in New Jersey so we at least get to do a bit of a road trip to watch some games but we don't get to see them in CONSOL, which is what we really wanted.</p>

<p>The irony/bad luck is that we arrive into JFK on the 21st of December, the same day the Pens play at home, but getting from JFK to Pittsburgh via car before the puck drops at midday is just not going to happen.</p>

<p>We aren't going to let this get us down though as we are going to thoroughly enjoy our time in Pittsburgh and see as much as we can. We are going to be searching Mount Lebanon and Cecil Township for potential places to live in the future, although as nice as Cecil looks I think Mount Lebanon will win due to the closeness to other amenities (such as ice rinks) and of course just a short ride to Pittsburgh itself.</p>

<p>The count down is now under 100 days and I can tell you things are starting to get exciting! Not only that, but the NHL season start is just around the corner so we'll have plenty to keep us occupied as the time counts down!</p></section>
