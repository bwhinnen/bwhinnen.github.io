          <p><section><p>The last update was all about migrating the blog to a new process, that seems like it was so long ago. Honestly I had to re-learn how to do it all and I've updated my computer since then. Lucky everything is on github!</p></p>

<p>Where did I leave off? That is right we were planning  on a great East Coast vacation. East Coast? Yes the East Coast of the USA. We had such a great time, expensive, but great!</p>

<p>Before the trip, I had to go to Syndey to visit the head office in Australia. I approached my direct manager about the possibility of moving to the USA for work. He was very positive about it, but as with all things in the company I work for (and especially work VISAs) these things take time so I put it out of my mind as we planned and went on our vacation.</p>

<p>The initial part of the trip was the hardest, 10 hours from Brisbane to Honolulu, a seven hour layover, then another 10 hours from Honolulu to New York City. That was just the beginning though, then there was the 8 hour drive from New York City to Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>The three week vacation took us through six states and two (well three including Australia) countries. It was such a good time and we all had a blast. I fell in love with Pittsburgh. This from my own perspective rather than seeing it through the eyes of people that live there.</p>

<p>After arriving back in the country we found out that things had progressed and that I needed to fill in a <i>heap</i> of paperwork and then we would need to go to Sydney to visit the Consulate General to petition our (well my) case for entering the USA for work purposes.</p>

<p>The amount of paperwork was astounding, 3lbs of paperwork came from the Immigration Lawyers in the USA and we made our appointments and booked our flights to Sydney. We made it some fun for Braden by going a day early and visiting Taronga Park Zoo. It was a bit brisk down there but we had a great time. The appointment itself, well we arrived early and went through the security and setup which was interesting in its own right. We then got to go to the interview area where some extra money was paid for the recipricated visa costs and anti-fraud charges and then the interview. I think the interview took all of 5 - 10 minutes and we had our visa!</p>

<p>Well that was easy (expensive and time consuming but easy). Then it sunk in, we were picking up and moving not across the country but across the world! We had just 4 weeks to get everything sorted and ourselves over to ... wait for it ... San Diego, California! Not our first choice but definitely not a problem. Beautiful weather, friendly people and a great place overall!</p>

<p>We decided that we'd fly over the same way as last time, use Hawaiian Airlines and go via Honolulu. A nice easy flight (relative to the last one). Organizing the move of our possessions was harder; not from finding who to move it, but what to move and what to sell and what to store. We ended up selling all of our electronics bar my computer and Vicki's iMac. All of the large furniture was also sold. The cars were the hardest part. Vicki's took about 3 months to sell and mine took a further 3 months!</p>

<p>The next step was getting the house ready and also finding a tennant. Luckily we had a few pamphlets for painters and such which made things a bit easier. In the end we had the house re-painted (almost all of it). The yeard cleaned up and the place ready for a new family to move in. The house was empty for around four weeks before a great couple moved in to call it home.</p>

<p>Our flight over was easy, just as we thought it would be. Immigration took longer than we expected this time though, but in the end we had the stamps in place and were legal aliens within the USA! We arrived in San Diego at around 10PM, transferred to the hotel which was to become our home for the next few weeks</p>

<p>Friday was a busy day with picking up the hire car, visiting the Credit Union to get our debit cards, finalize the opening of our first USA account and visiting the office and meeting my new colleagues and bosses.</p>

<p>Everyone was great, but the thing that resonated the most was how difficult it was going to be to find a place to live. That and the fact that we no longer had any credit history what-so-ever! Suffice it to say we looked at about four different appartment (well condos in reality) complexes and found one we liked. This was on Saturday (yes the second day after arriving), we signed a lease on that day and because I'd been with the company for 10+ years the security deposit was the same as it would be for any US person with good credit! We were to move in the following Tuesday! Amazing!</p>

<p>I can say now that waiting to move over after completing 10 years with my company was a good idea. The long service leave I had saved up, really helped to pay for the move, the furnishing of our new place and generally restricting just how much we had to dip into our savings.</p>

<p>The next step in our adventure was to get our own car. While the hire car was good, it was not ours and cost considerably more than we wanted to spend indefinitely. Having no credit history is just as bad as having a bad one we found out. We looked at a new car, just $30,000 (cheap by Australian costs) but with our lack of credit the dealer wanted $25,000 down and then a 20% load over the next 60 months! Ha, you've got to be kidding! We ended up buying a second hand Mercedes ML350 (9 years and 120,000 miles old) for cash and that did us well for almost 12 months.</p>

<p>We got Braden enrolled in school, which was easy and we were set. Thus began our new life for the next 3 - 5 years! I'll continue with some of our adventures over the next few weeks.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Well after doing all the sums and coming to the realisation that in reality the website for Whinnen.COM is simply a set of static pages it was not really worth using all the power of Wordpress. So I started a search for some other way to use GAE (Google App Engine) to serve up simple static pages of html.</p></p>

<p>I have to say that there are some pretty clever folks out there. I first found some information about a little project called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="jekyll">jekyll</a> that will use a plain text file (or markdown if you prefer) into a website using templates and some other goodness. Jekyll is based on rubygems so it is pretty much available for everything. It also ties in very nicely with <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub, inc">GitHub, Inc</a> and even allows you to use a GitHub based url to serve up your pages.</p>

<p>Obviously that is not quite what I want as I really would like Google to be the final resting place for our online presence. Some further searching using a simple search term of</p>

<p class="notice">jekyll google app engine</p>

<p>Came up with a ready made python application called <a href="http://drydrop.binaryage.com" title="DryDrop by binaryage">DryDrop</a> which allows you to autmatically update or cache pages from GitHub onto GAE simply by updating your GitHub repository. There were also some interesting pages to read on what people had done to achieve this.</p>

<p>Whilst playing around with it I soon realised that I would have to delve into css again, this is not really an issue but did prove to be interesting and I may post more on that later. One thing that is severely lacking in jekyll is the ability to have tags or categories displayed easily. After all using the liquid markup it is easy to put them into a post, but required some additional plugins to actually do anything with them.</p>

<p>I found a simple tag plugin from <a href="http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/" title="Tags In Jekyll">Charlie Park</a> that I adapted to also incorporate categories as well. Now this is not a "cloud" type of arrangement but simply gives me the ability to a) display the tags and categories on a post and b) actually have a page that lists all the posts that are in either the tag or category.</p>

      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'
      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'tag_index.html')
      self.data['tag'] = tag
      tag_title_prefix = site.config['tag_title_prefix'] || 'Posts Tagged &ldquo;'
      tag_title_suffix = site.config['tag_title_suffix'] || '&rdquo;'
      self.data['title'] = "#{tag_title_prefix}#{tag}#{tag_title_suffix}"
    end
  end
  class TagGenerator < Generator
    safe true
    def generate(site)
      if site.layouts.key? 'tag_index'
        dir = site.config['tag_dir'] || 'tag'
        site.tags.keys.each do |tag|
          write_tag_index(site, File.join(dir, tag), tag)
        end
      end
    end
    def write_tag_index(site, dir, tag)
      index = TagIndex.new(site, site.source, dir, tag)
      index.render(site.layouts, site.site_payload)
      index.write(site.dest)
      site.pages << index
    end
  end

<p>To make this fit in with my basic pages I used the following as my <i>_layouts/tag_index.html</i>. This gives me the ability to show a page that matches fully in with my primary archves style page.</p>

<p>One thing that using GAE and GitHub is that it gives me great speeds, there are no database reads, pages are cached and as long as I configure GAE to always have one instance available I get great responses at all times. Of course using git means that I also have a hsitory of all the changes, enforced version control!</p>

<p>Overall this saves me around $130 - $180 a year for just a database and some cloud storage that quite honestly I don't use. It also gives me the ability to get my hands dirty again with coding, which I really do need.</p></section>

<p><strong>Well thank you NHL</strong>, but with the devision realignment the schedules all changed! So that means for the entire time we are in Pittsburgh the Pens are not at home! Thankfully they are playing a game in nearby Ohio and then in New Jersey so we at least get to do a bit of a road trip to watch some games but we don't get to see them in CONSOL, which is what we really wanted.</p>

<p>The irony/bad luck is that we arrive into JFK on the 21st of December, the same day the Pens play at home, but getting from JFK to Pittsburgh via car before the puck drops at midday is just not going to happen.</p>

<p>We aren't going to let this get us down though as we are going to thoroughly enjoy our time in Pittsburgh and see as much as we can. We are going to be searching Mount Lebanon and Cecil Township for potential places to live in the future, although as nice as Cecil looks I think Mount Lebanon will win due to the closeness to other amenities (such as ice rinks) and of course just a short ride to Pittsburgh itself.</p>

<p>The count down is now under 100 days and I can tell you things are starting to get exciting! Not only that, but the NHL season start is just around the corner so we'll have plenty to keep us occupied as the time counts down!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I’ve run on a VSP now for a number of years, basically around 6 or 7 of them and have had a great deal of fun and learning in the process. There was a necessity based on running a photographic website for a little start-up company I had that fell through due to changing priorities as well as being able to get push based email out to various iDevices. Now with rising costs and really the fact that the only things I use the VPS for are email serving a Wordpress site and http based file storage the costs far outweighed the needs.</p></p>

<p>I began to setup Google Apps about a year ago, but never really took it any further. This time I did some more investigation and it turns out that full exchange (well ActiveSync) functionality is available to Google Apps for Businesses customers, the cost was $50 per user per calendar year. Not too bad overall, this means three accounts, one for each member of the family.</p>

<p>I could also host my files on Google Sites which also gave me much more storage and bandwidth space than the previous VPS did as well as more redundancy being Google. The photographic website was being closed so a basic landing page was the only thing required. The Wordpress site posed more of a problem as Google Sites does not allow anything of the sort, yes I could have used Blogger but I wanted to keep the same look and feel.</p>

<p>Google announced earlier this year that the Google Cloud Apps was going to start supporting php development, that meant that suddenly Wordpress was about to become available. The only catch, this was going to cost some money as both the Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage were billed on a usage basis. Projected costs are around $0.36 a day for Cloud SQL and not much for the Cloud Storage as I really don’t need much. Rough estimates run to under $150 a year. This combined with the Google Apps for Business still runs at less than the current VPS solution.</p>

<p>However, there were a few gotchas along the way.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. You can only create an alias name for a Google Site from the primary domain, I have three domains in total and really wanted two of those to be landing pages on Google Sites.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Solution: Get creative. I used a free hosting site that allowed me to use my domain name against an IP address, this allowed me to put a simple .htaccess with a permanent forward (301) in to point to the new Google Site alias. It did require access and changes to my DNS settings but after those changes it worked perfectly.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Google has no DNS hosting.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Solution: Most of the companies who register the domains for you will offer this as a free service. For me Melbourne IT does it and I had to transfer one domain over in order to get the features I needed, got a great deal on a 5 year registration for the domain too!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Google Cloud Apps will require billing.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Solution: Do it, it really is not all that expensive in the grand scheme of things, especially for the redundancy and scalability involved. While you can opt for daily rates there are also per use rates that can work out cheaper depending on how often your site is accessed. I went for the daily rate first to get all the teething and to allow the site to settle down.</p>

<p>Overall the process was pretty simple, the key areas are to make sure you know your ‘net presence and make sure you have backups of everything. Manage things in a staged approach and run a pilot, Google Apps makes this quite easy to do and they even have a one month trial on Google Apps for Business you can use towards the end of the pilot to make sure everything works as expected.</p>

<p>Getting my Wordpress site to Google Cloud Apps was a little harder but following an online guide and knowing how to use mysql helped a great deal. I will do up another article in the future that shows what I’ve done to get that working with minimal issues.</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Recently I've struggled a bit with Braden's HTPC and its remote setup. For some reason the Dell branded RC6 IR receiver and remote would not wake up his HTPC reliably resulting in him having to reach over the TV to turn on the HTPC himself. This to me is highly annoying as I like to be able to get settled and press a button, so to an eight year old I am sure it was equally annoying, especially one as technically minded as him.</p></p>

<p>Recently the <a title="OpenELEC" href="http://openelec.tv" target="_blank">OpenELEC</a> forum in conjunction with <a title="The Pi Hut" href="http://thepihut.com" target="_blank">The Pi Hut</a> and <a title="Flirc" href="http://flirc.tv" target="_blank">Flirc</a> had a competition (well it is still going on at the time of penning this note) to win a flirc device. I was one of the lucky ones to win one. I must of course say a big thank you to each of the team members involved from the three places, the prize is not only greatly appreciated but is immensely useful!</p>

<p>What is a flirc device? Simply it is a lovely, and I must say pretty sexy looking, USB compatible IR receiver that presents itself as a HID device to the OS. There is a simple programming application that can be run on OS X, Linux and of course Windows which allows it to capture any IR signal from any remote regardless of what proprietary codes it uses and then allocate these to a variety of functions. As I use XBMC I chose to use the full keyboard option as I could then have many different buttons to control the plethora of options that XBMC uses. The cool thing about the flirc is that you program it and it remembers the settings and you can then move it to any device with a USB port that supports HID functions with no further management or changes required to that end device.</p>

<p>Pretty cool! It meant that I could program it up and then move it onto the OpenELEC system and not have to do anything but use the remote, this is especially important as OpenELEC and XBMC itself has no way of changing the way the keyboard or remote works without delving down into the config files by hand via the base operating system, yes that is right no pretty GUI for those technically challenged people out there.</p>

<p>Of course I did have to modify the keyboard.xml file slightly as I wanted certain functionality to continue over from the old RC6 setup. One was the power button, to put the device to sleep, in this case I simply mapped the power button on the remote to the function 4 (F4) key and then setup the keyboard config to do a XBMC.Suspend() on receipt of that key press. The other main change was that the |&lt; and &gt;| buttons would do a skip in the video play mode, I wanted them to act like the remote and actually skip to the next item in the playlist (for music video clips especially), this was also a simple change on the keyboard configuration changing the , and . keys used by default to SkipPrevious and SkipNext.</p>

<p>Overall the flirc is an excellent device and well worth it. Even if I had to buy one outright I certainly would now as it is just as cheap as a RC6 setup from eBay, but with infinitely more uses and functionality!</p></section>
