          <p><section><p>Not really old movies but old movies for a six year old like Braden ... last night after getting back from ice skating we decided to watch some Beverly Hills Cop. Why I hear you ask? Simply because on the way to skate school on Saturday Axel F was playing on the stereo (yes I have some old music on my USB stick), and of course Braden knows this from Monsters V Aliens, but Vicki and I know it from Beverly Hills Cop! Off I went to get a copy of it, no small feat I must say where most of the older movies at the video store only have one copy of a well used DVD. I ended up getting all three movies for a weekly hire, I also grabbed Aladdin for Braden as I thought he might enjoy it, I know I did when I first saw it.</p></p>

<p>While watching Beverly Hills Cop, the original one, it really surprised me at how badly choreographed the fight scenes were. I mean the punches and elbows never even came close to connecting with the other person, seriously I never noticed that when I was 14 - 15? Is it that I am now older I have become more analytical of these movies, or is it simply that the newer well choreographed movies have raised the bar so? It makes me wonder what Braden thinks of some of the older movies like Star Trek, Star Wars that he has seen, when comparing them to the effects of movies such as Transformers, Avatar etc. I know he is six, but still he must notice the difference!</p>

<p>All in all though watching the two Beverly Hills Cop movies last night really was a trip back down memory lane, back when Eddie Murphy was really doing some of his good work, I think I'll have to go and find Coming to America next, another movie that I remember from my youth that had some great Eddie Murphy antics. Sometimes it is great to go back and re-watch those older movies you loved as a youngster, but on the flip-side, sometimes it is a big mistake to go back and realise just how corny or bad they really were and wonder at just where in life you were at the time!</p>

<p>This morning being a public holiday in Brisbane, for some, as I still have to work today, Braden is sitting watching Aladdin, he seems to be having a ball, I have heard the movie rewinded a few times already to re-play some bit he finds funny. I have also heard quite a few laughs and giggles coming from the lounge room as well. It really does make me smile knowing that he gets as much enjoyment as I did out of watching a movie that is so old, this exemplifies just how well Disney Studios did with their movies, they really are ageless.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Saturdays have turned into busy days for us lately although the mornings can start a little later due to skate school starting at 10:00am. I for one had a  bit of a sleep in this morning as did Braden, which he needed as he has a chesty cough and a little tired. The later waking up both this morning and Friday morning really helped Braden to keep going today while we were out and about.</p></p>

<p>Firstly we had skate school this morning and I am happy to say all of us have passed to the next levels, Braden moving from Novice 1 to Novice 2 and Vicki and I from Intermediate 1 to Hockey 1. I know that the instructor of us wanted to move us up, me a little prematurely as she knows that a) we don't need to know 3-turns and b) they aren't the easiest to do in hockey skates. I hear that Braden did a great job in his class this morning and really impressed his instructor, which is awesome work. Now we need to decide what we will do in the next 4 weeks of class, whether we transfer over to a Thursday afternoon so we can attend Hockey 1 or do we just use the 90 minutes on the ice for practice?</p>

<p>We followed this up by heading to Skatebiz to get some kit for Vicki and myself, this ended up taking longer than expected, but in reality it was time well spent. We both ended up with different helmets than we first though, both moving from the Bauer 2100 to an Easton Stealth S9, but the fit was so much more comfortable. Both helmets need to be ordered in, but that is not a problem as we won't be practicing for a few weeks yet. Vicki ended up getting some Bauer gloves, some X15's and decided she would get some pants as well and ended up getting Bauer X20's. I ended up getting some Easton S11 gloves, and wow they feel so good to use, can't wait to use them on the ice! We also grabbed a new bag for Braden so I could use the bigger one, we ended up with a small version of the Easton S10 small wheeled bag.</p>

<p>This afternoon was a very late lunch at Nandos and then a trip home to do some needed yard work for me, mowing the back yard of our yard and also the neighbours yard and Vicki getting stuck into some housework and re-arranging the hockey kit bags. Really not a very exciting finish to the day, but a necessary one to make sure we can do the fun things!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>This is a bit of a post to encompass both yesterday and today! Why? Because the inter-webs is broken, well today I am accessing it tethered to my iPhone which really reminds me of the slower speeds we used to receive when dial-up was the only affordable connection method.</p></p>

<p>Yesterday I had to head into the office and it was a busy day with cases, not to mention the hour and three quarters spent in the car getting to and from the office. I makes for a long day on its own without taking into consideration a hefty case load as well or of course the 50 million questions you get because of the novelty of having one of the senior support staff actually in the office! I think I spent around an hour and a half discussing problems, configs and solutions with various account team members and engineers. It is good for them though as they don't often get to speak to a so-called subject matter expert (well I am supposed to be one of them!).</p>

<p>This morning the Telco Field Service Engineer arrived at my home to look at my connection, sadly he shook his head and muttered about other calls in my area for the same issues. It seems that there is a problem in the area related to the actual network (or should I say NOT-work) and upstream synchronisation. Usually I have this problem when the outdoor cable splitter is corroded, but since they replaced my cable run from the street a few years ago that hasn't been happening so no quick fix this time.</p>

<p>So here I sit with my Mac Pro connected to my iPhone for inter-webs and my work laptop connected to the dill-berry (BlackBerry) for work inter-webs with a sick boy sitting in the lounge room watching TV hoping that I do not need to go into the office today. Although I know Braden will love the adventure of going into the city and my work as he always does.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>It was an advert from the 90's I think, or it could have even been from the 80's I can't quite remember. Nor can I remember the actual item they were advertising! But that proverb has pretty much summed up my last couple of days at work. Usually I finish up around the time I am supposed to but the last couple of days I've gone an hour over time, and today I had to leave work for tomorrow which I absolutely hate doing. But enough of work :)</p></p>

<p>Last night was a skating night, and great night it was, relatively quiet night and room to move and have a bit of fun. For me it was just a night for skating around rather than trying new things or practising for skate school. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the night and the hour and a half on the ice after the day I had yesterday. It seems that for me ice skating is just a nice relaxing thing to do, I just wish it wasn't so expensive so I could do more of it!</p>

<p>Braden of course did his usual and picked up a few girls, and I say girls I mean girls in their mid to late teens, they just seem drawn to him. He is pretty smug about it too when we ask him about his 'girlfriends' :) Vicki was asked if she wanted to join the women's ice hockey team and training sessions, and I think she will as well, which will be awesome for her, except it will probably mean she gets further and further ahead of me in skill level :) But I think it was really nice of them to ask her.</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Seriously, are we that caught up in our own little lives that we cannot accept others are different in some way? Context you say, yes that will help. This morning Hayley Williams from Paramore re-tweeted something from HumanRightsCampaign about three bills that are about to be passed in Tennessee and seriously WTF is that all about?</p></p>

<figcaption>HRC Tweet that started the ball rolling for me.</figcaption></figure>

<p> Looking at this the one that they are most concerned with at the moment is that elementary and middle schools would not even acknowledge any relationship other than heterosexual exists, so no gay relationships. I have an issue with this on two levels, elementary school level children should not really be exposed to the sexuality of a relationship at all and of course the primary issue that many activists have; how will this alienate a child who's parents are in a gay relationship. I mean come on people with the amount of bullying and segregation over any little difference out there today you want to add fuel to the fire that is anti-same sex relationships? You are doing more damage to the kids than you are doing to the adults in this case and that is not fair!</p>

<p>One of the other bills that is due to go through is one on bullying. Saying that it is OK to bully someone if it was a reflection of their ‘religious, philosophical, or political views;’. Seriously, you want to give kids the right to bully now? You may as well just hand them all clubs, dress them in half cured animal skins and let them go at it! That is how bad this bill is. It is bad enough at the moment that there are religious zealots out there who refuse to accept anything other than their own doctrine, unable to accept that others may differ and have vastly conflicting beliefs, but to put this religious bigotry to law? The second point, philosophical, well anyone who is philosophical in nature should be able to work around differences by virtue so that should not ever come into the equation, however this now gives the un-educated yet another avenue to bully.</p>

<p>I don't know how politics work in the USA at the moment, but here in Australia rather than advertising the plans, promises and agendas of a political party they now personally attack the opposition. This bullying already occurs in the adult world and is grossly passed off as 'political lobbying', bollox I say to that, it is cheap shots of people who should not be running for any level of Government. These people cannot function in a normal society, instead they turn to politics to satisfy a self inflated ego and belief that they are better than everyone else. The unfortunate thing is that if there were such a concept as an honest politician they wouldn't survive anyway, and thus the self-centred, bureaucratic jagoffs end up getting voted in by an equally un-educated population. In effect this bill will just allow this purely political bullying to now legally move into the younger and more impressionable generations. Disgusting!</p>

<p>The third bill is not one I have read up on much nor understand, but it revolves around the fact that parents must give permission before their children can join a club at school. It also states that the only available clubs will be in the students handbook. This could reflect that any club that does not fit into what the school would base as good and wholesome as unacceptable and therefore 'evil'. I can't comment too much on this one as we never had clubs at school where I went.</p>

<p>All in all I think society is really screwing it up for the younger generation, the do-gooders out there think they are doing the right thing. This really irks me as it is akin to the whole every student wins a prize and there are no second places, which is absolute rubbish and gives the kids a false sense of how the world works. There are winners and losers in this world and kids need to learn that they will not always win, but should always try their best and of course on the flip side they should always be gracious in winning and offer assistance to those that do not.</p>

<p>Really kids need to be taught tolerance, empathy and above all must learn that change is not a bad thing! Change is a part of our lives and we must learn to accept it and work with it and understand that we can always turn it to our or others advantages.</p></section>
