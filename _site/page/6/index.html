          <p><section><p>I don't know how I manage to do it or why I do it to myself. I somehow seem to get dragged into things at work that really I shouldn't be. There should be an entire level or two between me and the need to be customer facing for some things. In this instance I'm the developer of a software solution at work (not my usual role but something I took over about five or six years ago), I support the code, delivery kit, sales collateral, training etc in my spare time. A support case was opened and I have been called in to look at things and act as a liaison with another vendor, which is all fine and dandy, but rather than having the local support team involved with the customer they feel the need to pull me into the mix. Yes I can do it, but really, I should be working with the third party vendor on this only, the local teams, from account management, customer support, application support etc should be the ones fronting the meetings, not the developer.</p></p>

<p>Really do they want me in the meeting so I can say "See this single line of code ... this one small line where one variable is assigned the value from another? That is where it is failing." Do I know why? Well yes as a matter of fact I do know why, but I don't have the ability to work around it as I am reliant on that command working and there is no way to fork it off while we complete the rest of the logic flow. Crappy programming language, or sorry interpreted scripting language!</p>

<p>That was pretty much my evening unfortunately.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Today was Game 5 between the Devils and the Flyers, being played at the Wells Fargo Centre in Phildelphia. I say today but of course I am a day ahead of the USA so it was played on Tuesday night there of course. Now was it the re-introduction of Rinaldo, the loss of Giroux or the complete miss-handle by Bryzgalov that cost the Flyers the game? Or will they blame the very close offside call which resulted in a goal? Who really knows, but one thing we do know is that the Flyers fan-base really are a fickle bunch. Most of them booing their own team or leaving early. The few remaining fans actually cheering the team when they acknowledged the crowd at the end of their season.</p></p>

<p>Why did the Flyers lose in four straight games? Because the Devils (unlike the Pens) had a solid penalty kill and refused to play down at the Flyers level of retaliation play. Something other teams should really take on board for future meetings with them. In this game the Flyers were completely outclassed by a better team, a team that played as a team, that seemed to be everywhere on the ice at once (most of the time).</p>

<p>We currently have the Western Conference finals ready to go with the Kings and the Coyotes, which will prove to be an interesting series, the Kings have been dominating, but I really don't think either the Canucks or the Blues were playing at their best. The Coyotes have been playing hard but really did dominate the Preds. I'm going for the Coyotes on this one, purely because I don't like the City of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Eastern Conference still has three teams competing, the Devils have moved up, now it is between the Caps and the Rangers. Two rather interesting teams, two rather interesting sets of players and one coach that likes to whinge and whine a great deal, oh and of course drop the f-bomb more than me! Really I want the Rangers to win this one, but ultimately I don't think it matters as the Devils are the team I want to take the Conference finals and then step it up to the Cup!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I've trademarked the title as it was coined by the great duo over at <a title="Hockey's Finest - girls who dig hockey!" href="http://hockeysfinest.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hockey's Finest</a> and I think it is quite clever!</p></p>

<p>We've had a couple of what I term suspect hits over the last few days, the first being Ovechkin on Girardi. First view of that hit was "WTF Ovi!". I'm not Ovechkin's biggest fan, far from it, and he has displayed some rather poor judgement on hits in the past, but this was in my eyes blatant. He took a cursory swipe at the puck with his foot and then launched himself at Girardi, it looked to be a) leaving his feet and b) targeting the head. Looking at the slow motion video replays showed he hit shoulder to shoulder and that he may or may not of left his feet. I still think it was a targeted hit, so I guess the NHL are lucky it is not me who is in charge of player safety!! Shanahan decided that there was no malice to the hit, and that Girardi saw Ovechkin coming and there was no evidence of anything but a clean hit. I strike this up as a lucky one for Ovechkin. The hit and some analysis from the commentators below.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8myT-qqM0TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Giroux of the Flyers on the other hand, the minute I saw the late hit on Zubrus I thought, Shanabanned for sure! Leading up to the play you could see Giroux was annoyed at the officials, some sources say it was on a play by Brodeur outside of the trapezoid, others say it was the clean hit by Fayne that may have set it off where Giroux thought it deserved more. All I saw was an angry and animated Giroux taking out his anger on the closest Devils player that had the puck (well had being the operative word). This is disgusting behaviour from any player in a professional sport! People get angry yes, people lash out yes, but to do it when you are in the game against someone who has nothing to do with things, when you know the risk of suspension is high and your team is facing elimination from the playoffs? Not a smart play. I thought Giroux wasn't mad from the typical Flyers mold, I now know I was gravely mistaken, with this play and also the whole breaking the stick over the goal posts in a loss to the Pens in Game 5 ...</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XiLVsiQzQ-E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This is not the first time Shanahan has suspended someone, and someone who is quite the influential player for a team, when that team is facing elimination. He did it with James Neal when he (Neal) really did some rather stupid plays, one of them against Giroux ironically. Really what Shanahan is showing here is that anger and retaliation has no place on the ice, going out and hitting someone illegally just to hurt them is not on when you are frustrated or angry! It really does show the wrong side of the sport to those youngsters who look up to these players!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Not really old movies but old movies for a six year old like Braden ... last night after getting back from ice skating we decided to watch some Beverly Hills Cop. Why I hear you ask? Simply because on the way to skate school on Saturday Axel F was playing on the stereo (yes I have some old music on my USB stick), and of course Braden knows this from Monsters V Aliens, but Vicki and I know it from Beverly Hills Cop! Off I went to get a copy of it, no small feat I must say where most of the older movies at the video store only have one copy of a well used DVD. I ended up getting all three movies for a weekly hire, I also grabbed Aladdin for Braden as I thought he might enjoy it, I know I did when I first saw it.</p></p>

<p>While watching Beverly Hills Cop, the original one, it really surprised me at how badly choreographed the fight scenes were. I mean the punches and elbows never even came close to connecting with the other person, seriously I never noticed that when I was 14 - 15? Is it that I am now older I have become more analytical of these movies, or is it simply that the newer well choreographed movies have raised the bar so? It makes me wonder what Braden thinks of some of the older movies like Star Trek, Star Wars that he has seen, when comparing them to the effects of movies such as Transformers, Avatar etc. I know he is six, but still he must notice the difference!</p>

<p>All in all though watching the two Beverly Hills Cop movies last night really was a trip back down memory lane, back when Eddie Murphy was really doing some of his good work, I think I'll have to go and find Coming to America next, another movie that I remember from my youth that had some great Eddie Murphy antics. Sometimes it is great to go back and re-watch those older movies you loved as a youngster, but on the flip-side, sometimes it is a big mistake to go back and realise just how corny or bad they really were and wonder at just where in life you were at the time!</p>

<p>This morning being a public holiday in Brisbane, for some, as I still have to work today, Braden is sitting watching Aladdin, he seems to be having a ball, I have heard the movie rewinded a few times already to re-play some bit he finds funny. I have also heard quite a few laughs and giggles coming from the lounge room as well. It really does make me smile knowing that he gets as much enjoyment as I did out of watching a movie that is so old, this exemplifies just how well Disney Studios did with their movies, they really are ageless.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Saturdays have turned into busy days for us lately although the mornings can start a little later due to skate school starting at 10:00am. I for one had a  bit of a sleep in this morning as did Braden, which he needed as he has a chesty cough and a little tired. The later waking up both this morning and Friday morning really helped Braden to keep going today while we were out and about.</p></p>

<p>Firstly we had skate school this morning and I am happy to say all of us have passed to the next levels, Braden moving from Novice 1 to Novice 2 and Vicki and I from Intermediate 1 to Hockey 1. I know that the instructor of us wanted to move us up, me a little prematurely as she knows that a) we don't need to know 3-turns and b) they aren't the easiest to do in hockey skates. I hear that Braden did a great job in his class this morning and really impressed his instructor, which is awesome work. Now we need to decide what we will do in the next 4 weeks of class, whether we transfer over to a Thursday afternoon so we can attend Hockey 1 or do we just use the 90 minutes on the ice for practice?</p>

<p>We followed this up by heading to Skatebiz to get some kit for Vicki and myself, this ended up taking longer than expected, but in reality it was time well spent. We both ended up with different helmets than we first though, both moving from the Bauer 2100 to an Easton Stealth S9, but the fit was so much more comfortable. Both helmets need to be ordered in, but that is not a problem as we won't be practicing for a few weeks yet. Vicki ended up getting some Bauer gloves, some X15's and decided she would get some pants as well and ended up getting Bauer X20's. I ended up getting some Easton S11 gloves, and wow they feel so good to use, can't wait to use them on the ice! We also grabbed a new bag for Braden so I could use the bigger one, we ended up with a small version of the Easton S10 small wheeled bag.</p>

<p>This afternoon was a very late lunch at Nandos and then a trip home to do some needed yard work for me, mowing the back yard of our yard and also the neighbours yard and Vicki getting stuck into some housework and re-arranging the hockey kit bags. Really not a very exciting finish to the day, but a necessary one to make sure we can do the fun things!</p></section>
