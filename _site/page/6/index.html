<p>We've had a couple of what I term suspect hits over the last few days, the first being Ovechkin on Girardi. First view of that hit was "WTF Ovi!". I'm not Ovechkin's biggest fan, far from it, and he has displayed some rather poor judgement on hits in the past, but this was in my eyes blatant. He took a cursory swipe at the puck with his foot and then launched himself at Girardi, it looked to be a) leaving his feet and b) targeting the head. Looking at the slow motion video replays showed he hit shoulder to shoulder and that he may or may not of left his feet. I still think it was a targeted hit, so I guess the NHL are lucky it is not me who is in charge of player safety!! Shanahan decided that there was no malice to the hit, and that Girardi saw Ovechkin coming and there was no evidence of anything but a clean hit. I strike this up as a lucky one for Ovechkin. The hit and some analysis from the commentators below.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8myT-qqM0TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Giroux of the Flyers on the other hand, the minute I saw the late hit on Zubrus I thought, Shanabanned for sure! Leading up to the play you could see Giroux was annoyed at the officials, some sources say it was on a play by Brodeur outside of the trapezoid, others say it was the clean hit by Fayne that may have set it off where Giroux thought it deserved more. All I saw was an angry and animated Giroux taking out his anger on the closest Devils player that had the puck (well had being the operative word). This is disgusting behaviour from any player in a professional sport! People get angry yes, people lash out yes, but to do it when you are in the game against someone who has nothing to do with things, when you know the risk of suspension is high and your team is facing elimination from the playoffs? Not a smart play. I thought Giroux wasn't mad from the typical Flyers mold, I now know I was gravely mistaken, with this play and also the whole breaking the stick over the goal posts in a loss to the Pens in Game 5 ...</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XiLVsiQzQ-E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This is not the first time Shanahan has suspended someone, and someone who is quite the influential player for a team, when that team is facing elimination. He did it with James Neal when he (Neal) really did some rather stupid plays, one of them against Giroux ironically. Really what Shanahan is showing here is that anger and retaliation has no place on the ice, going out and hitting someone illegally just to hurt them is not on when you are frustrated or angry! It really does show the wrong side of the sport to those youngsters who look up to these players!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Not really old movies but old movies for a six year old like Braden ... last night after getting back from ice skating we decided to watch some Beverly Hills Cop. Why I hear you ask? Simply because on the way to skate school on Saturday Axel F was playing on the stereo (yes I have some old music on my USB stick), and of course Braden knows this from Monsters V Aliens, but Vicki and I know it from Beverly Hills Cop! Off I went to get a copy of it, no small feat I must say where most of the older movies at the video store only have one copy of a well used DVD. I ended up getting all three movies for a weekly hire, I also grabbed Aladdin for Braden as I thought he might enjoy it, I know I did when I first saw it.</p></p>

<p>While watching Beverly Hills Cop, the original one, it really surprised me at how badly choreographed the fight scenes were. I mean the punches and elbows never even came close to connecting with the other person, seriously I never noticed that when I was 14 - 15? Is it that I am now older I have become more analytical of these movies, or is it simply that the newer well choreographed movies have raised the bar so? It makes me wonder what Braden thinks of some of the older movies like Star Trek, Star Wars that he has seen, when comparing them to the effects of movies such as Transformers, Avatar etc. I know he is six, but still he must notice the difference!</p>

<p>All in all though watching the two Beverly Hills Cop movies last night really was a trip back down memory lane, back when Eddie Murphy was really doing some of his good work, I think I'll have to go and find Coming to America next, another movie that I remember from my youth that had some great Eddie Murphy antics. Sometimes it is great to go back and re-watch those older movies you loved as a youngster, but on the flip-side, sometimes it is a big mistake to go back and realise just how corny or bad they really were and wonder at just where in life you were at the time!</p>

<p>This morning being a public holiday in Brisbane, for some, as I still have to work today, Braden is sitting watching Aladdin, he seems to be having a ball, I have heard the movie rewinded a few times already to re-play some bit he finds funny. I have also heard quite a few laughs and giggles coming from the lounge room as well. It really does make me smile knowing that he gets as much enjoyment as I did out of watching a movie that is so old, this exemplifies just how well Disney Studios did with their movies, they really are ageless.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Saturdays have turned into busy days for us lately although the mornings can start a little later due to skate school starting at 10:00am. I for one had a  bit of a sleep in this morning as did Braden, which he needed as he has a chesty cough and a little tired. The later waking up both this morning and Friday morning really helped Braden to keep going today while we were out and about.</p></p>

<p>Firstly we had skate school this morning and I am happy to say all of us have passed to the next levels, Braden moving from Novice 1 to Novice 2 and Vicki and I from Intermediate 1 to Hockey 1. I know that the instructor of us wanted to move us up, me a little prematurely as she knows that a) we don't need to know 3-turns and b) they aren't the easiest to do in hockey skates. I hear that Braden did a great job in his class this morning and really impressed his instructor, which is awesome work. Now we need to decide what we will do in the next 4 weeks of class, whether we transfer over to a Thursday afternoon so we can attend Hockey 1 or do we just use the 90 minutes on the ice for practice?</p>

<p>We followed this up by heading to Skatebiz to get some kit for Vicki and myself, this ended up taking longer than expected, but in reality it was time well spent. We both ended up with different helmets than we first though, both moving from the Bauer 2100 to an Easton Stealth S9, but the fit was so much more comfortable. Both helmets need to be ordered in, but that is not a problem as we won't be practicing for a few weeks yet. Vicki ended up getting some Bauer gloves, some X15's and decided she would get some pants as well and ended up getting Bauer X20's. I ended up getting some Easton S11 gloves, and wow they feel so good to use, can't wait to use them on the ice! We also grabbed a new bag for Braden so I could use the bigger one, we ended up with a small version of the Easton S10 small wheeled bag.</p>

<p>This afternoon was a very late lunch at Nandos and then a trip home to do some needed yard work for me, mowing the back yard of our yard and also the neighbours yard and Vicki getting stuck into some housework and re-arranging the hockey kit bags. Really not a very exciting finish to the day, but a necessary one to make sure we can do the fun things!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>This is a bit of a post to encompass both yesterday and today! Why? Because the inter-webs is broken, well today I am accessing it tethered to my iPhone which really reminds me of the slower speeds we used to receive when dial-up was the only affordable connection method.</p></p>

<p>Yesterday I had to head into the office and it was a busy day with cases, not to mention the hour and three quarters spent in the car getting to and from the office. I makes for a long day on its own without taking into consideration a hefty case load as well or of course the 50 million questions you get because of the novelty of having one of the senior support staff actually in the office! I think I spent around an hour and a half discussing problems, configs and solutions with various account team members and engineers. It is good for them though as they don't often get to speak to a so-called subject matter expert (well I am supposed to be one of them!).</p>

<p>This morning the Telco Field Service Engineer arrived at my home to look at my connection, sadly he shook his head and muttered about other calls in my area for the same issues. It seems that there is a problem in the area related to the actual network (or should I say NOT-work) and upstream synchronisation. Usually I have this problem when the outdoor cable splitter is corroded, but since they replaced my cable run from the street a few years ago that hasn't been happening so no quick fix this time.</p>

<p>So here I sit with my Mac Pro connected to my iPhone for inter-webs and my work laptop connected to the dill-berry (BlackBerry) for work inter-webs with a sick boy sitting in the lounge room watching TV hoping that I do not need to go into the office today. Although I know Braden will love the adventure of going into the city and my work as he always does.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>It was an advert from the 90's I think, or it could have even been from the 80's I can't quite remember. Nor can I remember the actual item they were advertising! But that proverb has pretty much summed up my last couple of days at work. Usually I finish up around the time I am supposed to but the last couple of days I've gone an hour over time, and today I had to leave work for tomorrow which I absolutely hate doing. But enough of work :)</p></p>

<p>Last night was a skating night, and great night it was, relatively quiet night and room to move and have a bit of fun. For me it was just a night for skating around rather than trying new things or practising for skate school. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the night and the hour and a half on the ice after the day I had yesterday. It seems that for me ice skating is just a nice relaxing thing to do, I just wish it wasn't so expensive so I could do more of it!</p>

<p>Braden of course did his usual and picked up a few girls, and I say girls I mean girls in their mid to late teens, they just seem drawn to him. He is pretty smug about it too when we ask him about his 'girlfriends' :) Vicki was asked if she wanted to join the women's ice hockey team and training sessions, and I think she will as well, which will be awesome for her, except it will probably mean she gets further and further ahead of me in skill level :) But I think it was really nice of them to ask her.</p></section>
