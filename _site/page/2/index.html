          <p><section></p>Recently I've struggled a bit with Braden's HTPC and its remote setup. For some reason the Dell branded RC6 IR receiver and remote would not wake up his HTPC reliably resulting in him having to reach over the TV to turn on the HTPC himself. This to me is highly annoying as I like to be able to get settled and press a button, so to an eight year old I am sure it was equally annoying, especially one as technically minded as him.</p></p>

<p>Recently the <a title="OpenELEC" href="http://openelec.tv" target="_blank">OpenELEC</a> forum in conjunction with <a title="The Pi Hut" href="http://thepihut.com" target="_blank">The Pi Hut</a> and <a title="Flirc" href="http://flirc.tv" target="_blank">Flirc</a> had a competition (well it is still going on at the time of penning this note) to win a flirc device. I was one of the lucky ones to win one. I must of course say a big thank you to each of the team members involved from the three places, the prize is not only greatly appreciated but is immensely useful!</p>

<p>What is a flirc device? Simply it is a lovely, and I must say pretty sexy looking, USB compatible IR receiver that presents itself as a HID device to the OS. There is a simple programming application that can be run on OS X, Linux and of course Windows which allows it to capture any IR signal from any remote regardless of what proprietary codes it uses and then allocate these to a variety of functions. As I use XBMC I chose to use the full keyboard option as I could then have many different buttons to control the plethora of options that XBMC uses. The cool thing about the flirc is that you program it and it remembers the settings and you can then move it to any device with a USB port that supports HID functions with no further management or changes required to that end device.</p>

<p>Pretty cool! It meant that I could program it up and then move it onto the OpenELEC system and not have to do anything but use the remote, this is especially important as OpenELEC and XBMC itself has no way of changing the way the keyboard or remote works without delving down into the config files by hand via the base operating system, yes that is right no pretty GUI for those technically challenged people out there.</p>

<p>Of course I did have to modify the keyboard.xml file slightly as I wanted certain functionality to continue over from the old RC6 setup. One was the power button, to put the device to sleep, in this case I simply mapped the power button on the remote to the function 4 (F4) key and then setup the keyboard config to do a XBMC.Suspend() on receipt of that key press. The other main change was that the |&lt; and &gt;| buttons would do a skip in the video play mode, I wanted them to act like the remote and actually skip to the next item in the playlist (for music video clips especially), this was also a simple change on the keyboard configuration changing the , and . keys used by default to SkipPrevious and SkipNext.</p>

<p>Overall the flirc is an excellent device and well worth it. Even if I had to buy one outright I certainly would now as it is just as cheap as a RC6 setup from eBay, but with infinitely more uses and functionality!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I (and I guess we) have had cable TV for a number of years, who am I kidding, we had it before moving to Brisbane, and that was almost 10 years ago now. As of yesterday I finally got around to cutting the cable fully. We dropped off of the $100+ Foxtel package in 2011 as we weren't really watching it and were disappointed with the amount (well lack of) NHL and MLB coverage that it had to warrant the sports channels. It really did make more sense to upgrade the internet to a 500GB package in order to take advantage of the NHL and MLB apps on the AppleTV than to be limited to the paltry three to four games a week, often of teams we weren't interested in.</p></p>

<p>I tried to cancel back then but got talked into keeping the IQ2 box and paying $10 a month to keep the free to air channels. This made sense as we didn't have any aerial to be able to get free to air over the actual air. And the $10 a month wasn't all that bad in reality. Fast forward to 2013, and I can count the number of times that we've had the IQ2 box turned on to watch free to air TV on, well, one finger. Yes a thorough waste of $10 a month over the last 18months or so.</p>

<p>We've had a media PC or HTPC as they are called for a number of years now as well, from the days of us having a CRT TV still to be exact. It used to run Windows Media Centre and MediaBrowser on Vista and then Windows 7 before I finally discovered and configured up XBMC. From there I moved to a wonderful system called OpenELEC which is a simple very cut down Linux distribution that ONLY runs XBMC. A very small footprint that boots very quickly and with the release of XBMC 12 (Frodo) supports full HD video and audio formats which is fantastic and had everything needed.</p>

<p>As XBMC Frodo fully supports PVR capabilities I have often thought of toying with Live TV but not having an aerial has held me back. Some research while I was bored showed that we had direct line of sight to the transmission tower, just a mere 19.2km away. Here I thought the tower was on the other side of the hill we live on, but no there it is toying with me. I could of course spend several hundred (around $300) to have an external aerial installed and all the cabling done, but I'm a cheapskate and only need one location wired in. I started looking at internal aerials and what they could achieve, it seems that a familiar "cheap" brand, Crest made an internal 42dB aerial with amplifier and Office Works had it on clearance for $80. Nice! Then I needed a TV tuner, well I had this old Dell laptop laying about that was doing nothing (we are pretty much an Apple household now), so I looked at cheap (this was only going to be a POC you understand) USB tuner. Office Works comes to the rescue again, with a USB 2.0 single tuner from Leadtek that I know works with both OpenELEC and MythTV.</p>

<p>I then downloaded mythbuntu (I'm lazy and didn't want to have to install ubuntu and then get all the relevant packages to create a MythTV backend server), installed it on the laptop and started configuring. It took me a couple of hours but I had things tuned in and kind of running, then started on the EPG data (essential for recording and nice to see what is on TV) before mucking about with the front end. A long story short I had TV on the various HTPCs around the house by the evening, I was pretty chuffed, Vicki was kind of ho-hum, but hey what floats my boat right?</p>

<p>The next morning I noted that all of the Channel 7 stations were, well, crap, so I decided to move the aerial up into the ceiling space, that was fun, but in the end I had it moved, the laptop moved to a better position mounted on the wall (I use VNC to control it) and used an existing hole in the wall to feed the aerial and power cables through. Wonderful I thought, yes right, the Channel 7 stations were still horrific! I then did some searching for fine tuning capabilities and so forth and found many people having issues with Channel 7. Solutions included fine tuning, new cables, and re-scanning for the station. I chose the later, especially now the aerial was in the right spot, pointed in the right direction and had no big metal garage doors in the line of sight!</p>

<p>That was the correct decision it turns out, all stations were lovely and reception was great. Then came cleaning up the stations presented to the HTPC and downloading the channel icons, the later not essential, but looks good :)<p>

<p>Once that was all done I called Foxtel and cancelled my account fully, not before they once again tried to talk me into staying with great discounted rates! No, No, NO! I just wanted out. We don't watch free to air TV very much, well at all, but having it there for visitors is always handy, especially the 'rents and older generations who like to watch the News and other Current Affairs type programs. All of our media has been made available digitally on a NAS, so we have all our DVD's, BluRays and CD's online all the time and thus don't really need to watch TV as we can easily wait to buy the relevant title and then re-encode for use with XBMC.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I posted a while back that we would be going to Pittsburgh for Halloween. Well after consideration we decided that taking Braden out of school for a couple of weeks was probably not the best idea so I put a suggestion to Vicki.</p></p>

<p>Christmas! Yes a potential white Christmas in Pittsburgh. Probably one of the better ideas I've had recently. It was settled pretty quickly and I can say that now we've booked flights, accommodation and the hire car we need.</p>

<p>The trip will be more than just Pittsburgh, we will be flying from Brisbane to Honolulu then to New York via Hawaiian Airlines, picking up the car and driving across PA to Pittsburgh, I'm excited and a little apprehensive about the drive given we will not know the weather conditions until we get there and of course the 10 hour red-eye flight from Honolulu to New York. We will be in Pittsburgh for around eight days and hope to catch a few hockey games as well as practices for the Penguins. That is a bonus to the trip, we are using it to decide if we really do want to move there and if so where we could live. We've been given Mount Lebanon as a potential place by an ex-burgher and it is one of the areas we will be researching.</p>

<p>The trip will also include a couple of days out where we drive to see Niagra Falls on the way to Toronto, Vicki really wants to go to Canada this time and we are going to take the opportunity to see the Hockey Hall of Fame and maybe catch a hockey game in Toronto as well (maybe).</p>

<p>The way home will include a few dye in New York City itself followed by a flight back to Hawaii to relax and recuperate before the flight home. All up we are spending three weeks away and we are really looking forward to the break and also seeing more of the United States of America and especially meeting the people of Pittsburgh.</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Did you know that according to several studies and so-called boffins that you should be happy if you meet three certain criteria. Article link can be found here on the <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health-fitness/deakin-university-surveys-reveal-golden-triangle-of-happiness/story-fni0dgux-1226672800578" target="_blank">Herald Sun</a> website. Yes I am talking about the so-called "golden triangle of happiness". Let me just simply state that there is no such thing as a "golden triangle of happiness", anyone who believes this really has no understanding of the depth and breadth of mental illnesses such as depression with all it pertains. In a so-called <em>enlightened</em> society to have this touted in a <em>Lifestyle</em> section of a major media outlet is a travesty and undermines the excellent work done by so many health workers and organisations around the country and indeed the world.</p>

<p>Anyone who has suffered from a mental illness knows that it does not differentiate, it does not care who you are, what you have or how <em>happy</em> you should be. For many it is a dark and lonely battle that is fought on many fronts, alone because of opinions like this and the stigma associated with them. People are often too scared to confide in others for fear of what they will say, how they will react and more often than not comments such as "You are exaggerating, just snap out of it" or "It is just a phase, everyone gets down from time to time" and of course the old "You have the best life, family, friends, money, a job, you want for nothing, you have no reason or right to be un-happy!". Starting to sound familiar? Of course it is, especially from the vast majority people out there have not suffered from depression and as such do not understand what you are going through or have been through but believe they do based on pre-conceived ideology. Some people do of course understand, and these people are to be cherished!</p>

<p>How can I say this? Quite simply my life has been many ups and downs, much the same as everyone else, well so I thought. I was one of those people who thought to myself, "just snap out of it, you have no reason to be like this", but I could not, really it was just denial on my part. I've spent many years in a state of overwhelming turmoil, that is the easiest way to describe it in few words without spending an eternity trying to explain the variances of feelings. There are very few people that know this about me, and even less that had a clue that there was something wrong. That does not mean they are not observant, it simply means that like so many with depression I hid it extremely well. People would see mood swings, but never the full extent of how I was feeling internally, they would put it down to having a bad day or week. So yes I can to some extent, say that I do understand what people go through with depression as it is something I am currently going through, something that I want to change and have finally called out for help with.</p>

<p>The article really does not help anyone, it does not help those suffering from depression, nor does it help those close to those suffering or the general population who already have pre-conceived ideas. All it does is put mental health issues back into the darks days of medicine, when there was little understanding of the issues let alone the causes. I've seen many different reactions from people that I know when I've told them I am suffering from depression and that I am now on medication to help me get to a place where I can at least sort some things out and the underlining message in this article really solidifies some of those <del>poor</del> uneducated attitudes.</p>

<p>Really the article in general takes the whole plethora of mental health issues and glosses them over with three simple rules that will make ones life <em>happy</em>. It is a slap in the face to anyone who suffers from depression whether or not they meet those three criteria. Honestly who thought that publicising such findings in the way they did would be a good idea; it will not suddenly make those suffering change, it will not make things <em>all better</em> just knowing that they <em>should</em> be happy according to someones interpretations of findings made in 29 surveys over 12 years. If only life were that easy. I like so many people meet all three criteria and still suffer from depression and now things have just been made that much more difficult with peers when they realise that I really have no reason to be depressed at all.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I really should. I find that I try and find something really meaningful to write about, something mind-blowingly awesome, but of course never find anything. What I should be doing is just writing things that happen, after all this is what I wanted to do with the blog rather than trying to be all 'clever' and 'sophisticated'!</p></p>

<p>So what I will be trying to write things that are happening around here and in my and our lives. It won't be prize winning prose but at least it will be honest and real.</p>

<p>Today is Friday, I'm taking a mental health day, yes I do need it, but to top things off the poor boy had an episode last night with some vomiting, well three counts of vomiting on his way to the bathroom. One in his bedroom, one in the family room and one at the entrance to the bathroom. All at around 1:00am this morning. Poor little tacker, he was thrown in the shower while we cleaned up. I must admit that is my most hated job in the world, cleaning up after someone that has been sick is never fun.</p>

<p>He has been up all night, and is still awake at 11:00am, but as of 7:00am he has stopped vomiting, which is a relief, but is now running a wondrous 38.9ºC temperature. But he is now taking fluids and medicine as well as eating a few Arnott's Milk Arrowroot biscuits and is actually quite lucid for someone who is running a fever and has a distinct lack of sleep.</p>

<p>Vicki had to go into the office this morning for a few hours to do the banking as her boss was away, which I am sure was a real chore on just a few paltry hours sleep. We are now all just relaxing at home doing very little for the rest of the day as the boy recovers and we keep a close eye on him.</p></section>
