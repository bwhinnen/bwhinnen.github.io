          <p><section><p>I posted a while back that we would be going to Pittsburgh for Halloween. Well after consideration we decided that taking Braden out of school for a couple of weeks was probably not the best idea so I put a suggestion to Vicki.</p></p>

<p>Christmas! Yes a potential white Christmas in Pittsburgh. Probably one of the better ideas I've had recently. It was settled pretty quickly and I can say that now we've booked flights, accommodation and the hire car we need.</p>

<p>The trip will be more than just Pittsburgh, we will be flying from Brisbane to Honolulu then to New York via Hawaiian Airlines, picking up the car and driving across PA to Pittsburgh, I'm excited and a little apprehensive about the drive given we will not know the weather conditions until we get there and of course the 10 hour red-eye flight from Honolulu to New York. We will be in Pittsburgh for around eight days and hope to catch a few hockey games as well as practices for the Penguins. That is a bonus to the trip, we are using it to decide if we really do want to move there and if so where we could live. We've been given Mount Lebanon as a potential place by an ex-burgher and it is one of the areas we will be researching.</p>

<p>The trip will also include a couple of days out where we drive to see Niagra Falls on the way to Toronto, Vicki really wants to go to Canada this time and we are going to take the opportunity to see the Hockey Hall of Fame and maybe catch a hockey game in Toronto as well (maybe).</p>

<p>The way home will include a few dye in New York City itself followed by a flight back to Hawaii to relax and recuperate before the flight home. All up we are spending three weeks away and we are really looking forward to the break and also seeing more of the United States of America and especially meeting the people of Pittsburgh.</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Did you know that according to several studies and so-called boffins that you should be happy if you meet three certain criteria. Article link can be found here on the <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health-fitness/deakin-university-surveys-reveal-golden-triangle-of-happiness/story-fni0dgux-1226672800578" target="_blank">Herald Sun</a> website. Yes I am talking about the so-called "golden triangle of happiness". Let me just simply state that there is no such thing as a "golden triangle of happiness", anyone who believes this really has no understanding of the depth and breadth of mental illnesses such as depression with all it pertains. In a so-called <em>enlightened</em> society to have this touted in a <em>Lifestyle</em> section of a major media outlet is a travesty and undermines the excellent work done by so many health workers and organisations around the country and indeed the world.</p>

<p>Anyone who has suffered from a mental illness knows that it does not differentiate, it does not care who you are, what you have or how <em>happy</em> you should be. For many it is a dark and lonely battle that is fought on many fronts, alone because of opinions like this and the stigma associated with them. People are often too scared to confide in others for fear of what they will say, how they will react and more often than not comments such as "You are exaggerating, just snap out of it" or "It is just a phase, everyone gets down from time to time" and of course the old "You have the best life, family, friends, money, a job, you want for nothing, you have no reason or right to be un-happy!". Starting to sound familiar? Of course it is, especially from the vast majority people out there have not suffered from depression and as such do not understand what you are going through or have been through but believe they do based on pre-conceived ideology. Some people do of course understand, and these people are to be cherished!</p>

<p>How can I say this? Quite simply my life has been many ups and downs, much the same as everyone else, well so I thought. I was one of those people who thought to myself, "just snap out of it, you have no reason to be like this", but I could not, really it was just denial on my part. I've spent many years in a state of overwhelming turmoil, that is the easiest way to describe it in few words without spending an eternity trying to explain the variances of feelings. There are very few people that know this about me, and even less that had a clue that there was something wrong. That does not mean they are not observant, it simply means that like so many with depression I hid it extremely well. People would see mood swings, but never the full extent of how I was feeling internally, they would put it down to having a bad day or week. So yes I can to some extent, say that I do understand what people go through with depression as it is something I am currently going through, something that I want to change and have finally called out for help with.</p>

<p>The article really does not help anyone, it does not help those suffering from depression, nor does it help those close to those suffering or the general population who already have pre-conceived ideas. All it does is put mental health issues back into the darks days of medicine, when there was little understanding of the issues let alone the causes. I've seen many different reactions from people that I know when I've told them I am suffering from depression and that I am now on medication to help me get to a place where I can at least sort some things out and the underlining message in this article really solidifies some of those <del>poor</del> uneducated attitudes.</p>

<p>Really the article in general takes the whole plethora of mental health issues and glosses them over with three simple rules that will make ones life <em>happy</em>. It is a slap in the face to anyone who suffers from depression whether or not they meet those three criteria. Honestly who thought that publicising such findings in the way they did would be a good idea; it will not suddenly make those suffering change, it will not make things <em>all better</em> just knowing that they <em>should</em> be happy according to someones interpretations of findings made in 29 surveys over 12 years. If only life were that easy. I like so many people meet all three criteria and still suffer from depression and now things have just been made that much more difficult with peers when they realise that I really have no reason to be depressed at all.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I really should. I find that I try and find something really meaningful to write about, something mind-blowingly awesome, but of course never find anything. What I should be doing is just writing things that happen, after all this is what I wanted to do with the blog rather than trying to be all 'clever' and 'sophisticated'!</p></p>

<p>So what I will be trying to write things that are happening around here and in my and our lives. It won't be prize winning prose but at least it will be honest and real.</p>

<p>Today is Friday, I'm taking a mental health day, yes I do need it, but to top things off the poor boy had an episode last night with some vomiting, well three counts of vomiting on his way to the bathroom. One in his bedroom, one in the family room and one at the entrance to the bathroom. All at around 1:00am this morning. Poor little tacker, he was thrown in the shower while we cleaned up. I must admit that is my most hated job in the world, cleaning up after someone that has been sick is never fun.</p>

<p>He has been up all night, and is still awake at 11:00am, but as of 7:00am he has stopped vomiting, which is a relief, but is now running a wondrous 38.9ºC temperature. But he is now taking fluids and medicine as well as eating a few Arnott's Milk Arrowroot biscuits and is actually quite lucid for someone who is running a fever and has a distinct lack of sleep.</p>

<p>Vicki had to go into the office this morning for a few hours to do the banking as her boss was away, which I am sure was a real chore on just a few paltry hours sleep. We are now all just relaxing at home doing very little for the rest of the day as the boy recovers and we keep a close eye on him.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>That is correct people still have out of date instructions for upgrading things. Our website and email services are all hosted on a HyperVM based VPS, it is currently running Debian 5.0 and is restricted to a kernel version of 2.6.18, while on its own this is not a great drama it can be a little restrictive as the kernel and Debian version cannot be updated easily.</p></p>

<p>In my infinite wisdom, well in my defence it was required, I decided to update the mail server software (Zarafa) to the current version 7.1 from the 7.05 I was previously running. As always I do my due diligence of reading the release notes, update guide etc. Lucky for me I did and took a full backup of the mail database! Running through the notes it tells you to do certain steps at certain times, and of course being on Debian it uses dpkg to install the locally held packages you receive as part of the Zarafa distribution. Well this is usually all well and good, doing the installs and following the notes is generally not an issue, they have been in the past very good.</p>

<p>This time, they have split up certain functionality into other modules, one of which needs a new package to be installed which is NOT referenced in the upgrade guide anywhere. Of course me being me I googled it and found that I needed to add a certain source to my sources.list file. Well that was mistake number one! The source I added just happened to be the new Debian distribution "sid", I didn't realise this until WAY too late, after updating umpteen packages and suddenly finding that I needed to have a newer kernel installed to support libc6, oops!</p>

<p>So some quick investigation shows that I can get a new VPS with my current hosting company and it will support a) custom kernels, b) Debian 6.0 and future releases and c) it is faster, and more well appointed. The catch, it costs an extra $50 a year, big whoopie, and I have to migrate everything and set it back up. I go through the trouble of setting it up and use the same sources.list I used previously, with the exception of Debian 6.0 sources instead of Debian 5.0 sources, but of course I hadn't clicked that the "sid" source was a new distribution/version yet. So go through most of the setup and then realise that I've screwed the pooch. Start again, this time knowing what I've done wrong.</p>

<p>Now installing Zarafa 7.1 I find I still need that same package, but where will I get it? ... Oh come on, seriously, it was included in the distribution all along? So did I go through all this trouble for naught? Well yes and no. Yes because I did extra work I didn't need to do and spent money I really didn't need to, and things would have kept running away for a while. No because I did need to update to a later version of Debian as 5.0 is pretty much unsupported and I need to keep on top of security patches etc and of course the new VPS is quite speedy in comparison!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>After our last vacation to Hawaii we were all set to continue the yearly tradition (as it has become) and head back there again next year for our annual vacation.</p></p>

<p>As usual when we talk about things Vicki and I always come up with new ideas and of course we (by this I mean Vicki) raised an option of visiting the USA during Halloween, that is around October 31st. Which of course is right in the middle of a school term and at the end of month for Vicki's new job. As Braden is only in Grade 2 next year we thought that as long as we take some work with us he can keep mostly up to date with what is going on, after all homework is not all that time consuming or difficult. Vicki checked with her new work and they are flexible so the dates are mostly set.</p>

<p>However, the location was not. With every good intention of returning to Hawaii in mind other events have since changed the destination for some very valid reasons. You see we have each applied for entry into the Diversity Visa Lottery, or more commonly known as the Green Card lottery that the US Department of State holds each year. The results of this lottery will be available in May 2013 with entry into the United States in 2014. With this in mind and of course our initial decision to move to Pittsburgh, PA we decided it would probably be a good idea to visit and scout around the area to see if we actually like it and could see ourselves settling there for the long term.</p>

<p>Instead of a pretty relaxing vacation to Hawaii we are now looking at something a little more hectic with a trip to Pittsburgh. Of course getting there is the first issue, wanting to limit the number of flights we need to take is a priority, it seems that BNE to PIT is not the easiest of routes. We can go BNE - SYD - SFO - PIT or BNE - LAX - DFW - PIT or BNE - LAX - SFO - PIT and so forth, what we'd really like to do is BNE - SFO - PIT as this gives us an option to spend a day or two in San Francisco which we've only visited for the day previously.</p>

<p>But flights aside, the things to do in Pittsburgh are suddenly increasing, there is of course NHL game(s) to attend, assuming the lockout is over and done with by then! Then of course there should be NFL games on as well, seeings as Braden took a shine to NFL when we were in Hawaii. There will be no MLB on at that time though, unless of course the Buccos surprise every one and make the post season, come on it is possible, they had a great run this year, but couldn't keep up the pace. A visit to Southpointe to see the Penguins practice will be awesome almost as much as watching them play. Then of course we cannot forget all the looking around, eating and Halloween, although on the last item we do need to find somewhere "family" friendly where we can take Braden trick-or-treating.</p>

<p>To say I am excited about this next vacation is an understatement, I am super excited and have even petitioned some people on Twitter I follow for recommendations!</p></section>
