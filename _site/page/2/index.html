          <p><section></p>Did you know that according to several studies and so-called boffins that you should be happy if you meet three certain criteria. Article link can be found here on the <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/health-fitness/deakin-university-surveys-reveal-golden-triangle-of-happiness/story-fni0dgux-1226672800578" target="_blank">Herald Sun</a> website. Yes I am talking about the so-called "golden triangle of happiness". Let me just simply state that there is no such thing as a "golden triangle of happiness", anyone who believes this really has no understanding of the depth and breadth of mental illnesses such as depression with all it pertains. In a so-called <em>enlightened</em> society to have this touted in a <em>Lifestyle</em> section of a major media outlet is a travesty and undermines the excellent work done by so many health workers and organisations around the country and indeed the world.</p>

<p>Anyone who has suffered from a mental illness knows that it does not differentiate, it does not care who you are, what you have or how <em>happy</em> you should be. For many it is a dark and lonely battle that is fought on many fronts, alone because of opinions like this and the stigma associated with them. People are often too scared to confide in others for fear of what they will say, how they will react and more often than not comments such as "You are exaggerating, just snap out of it" or "It is just a phase, everyone gets down from time to time" and of course the old "You have the best life, family, friends, money, a job, you want for nothing, you have no reason or right to be un-happy!". Starting to sound familiar? Of course it is, especially from the vast majority people out there have not suffered from depression and as such do not understand what you are going through or have been through but believe they do based on pre-conceived ideology. Some people do of course understand, and these people are to be cherished!</p>

<p>How can I say this? Quite simply my life has been many ups and downs, much the same as everyone else, well so I thought. I was one of those people who thought to myself, "just snap out of it, you have no reason to be like this", but I could not, really it was just denial on my part. I've spent many years in a state of overwhelming turmoil, that is the easiest way to describe it in few words without spending an eternity trying to explain the variances of feelings. There are very few people that know this about me, and even less that had a clue that there was something wrong. That does not mean they are not observant, it simply means that like so many with depression I hid it extremely well. People would see mood swings, but never the full extent of how I was feeling internally, they would put it down to having a bad day or week. So yes I can to some extent, say that I do understand what people go through with depression as it is something I am currently going through, something that I want to change and have finally called out for help with.</p>

<p>The article really does not help anyone, it does not help those suffering from depression, nor does it help those close to those suffering or the general population who already have pre-conceived ideas. All it does is put mental health issues back into the darks days of medicine, when there was little understanding of the issues let alone the causes. I've seen many different reactions from people that I know when I've told them I am suffering from depression and that I am now on medication to help me get to a place where I can at least sort some things out and the underlining message in this article really solidifies some of those <del>poor</del> uneducated attitudes.</p>

<p>Really the article in general takes the whole plethora of mental health issues and glosses them over with three simple rules that will make ones life <em>happy</em>. It is a slap in the face to anyone who suffers from depression whether or not they meet those three criteria. Honestly who thought that publicising such findings in the way they did would be a good idea; it will not suddenly make those suffering change, it will not make things <em>all better</em> just knowing that they <em>should</em> be happy according to someones interpretations of findings made in 29 surveys over 12 years. If only life were that easy. I like so many people meet all three criteria and still suffer from depression and now things have just been made that much more difficult with peers when they realise that I really have no reason to be depressed at all.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I really should. I find that I try and find something really meaningful to write about, something mind-blowingly awesome, but of course never find anything. What I should be doing is just writing things that happen, after all this is what I wanted to do with the blog rather than trying to be all 'clever' and 'sophisticated'!</p></p>

<p>So what I will be trying to write things that are happening around here and in my and our lives. It won't be prize winning prose but at least it will be honest and real.</p>

<p>Today is Friday, I'm taking a mental health day, yes I do need it, but to top things off the poor boy had an episode last night with some vomiting, well three counts of vomiting on his way to the bathroom. One in his bedroom, one in the family room and one at the entrance to the bathroom. All at around 1:00am this morning. Poor little tacker, he was thrown in the shower while we cleaned up. I must admit that is my most hated job in the world, cleaning up after someone that has been sick is never fun.</p>

<p>He has been up all night, and is still awake at 11:00am, but as of 7:00am he has stopped vomiting, which is a relief, but is now running a wondrous 38.9ºC temperature. But he is now taking fluids and medicine as well as eating a few Arnott's Milk Arrowroot biscuits and is actually quite lucid for someone who is running a fever and has a distinct lack of sleep.</p>

<p>Vicki had to go into the office this morning for a few hours to do the banking as her boss was away, which I am sure was a real chore on just a few paltry hours sleep. We are now all just relaxing at home doing very little for the rest of the day as the boy recovers and we keep a close eye on him.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>That is correct people still have out of date instructions for upgrading things. Our website and email services are all hosted on a HyperVM based VPS, it is currently running Debian 5.0 and is restricted to a kernel version of 2.6.18, while on its own this is not a great drama it can be a little restrictive as the kernel and Debian version cannot be updated easily.</p></p>

<p>In my infinite wisdom, well in my defence it was required, I decided to update the mail server software (Zarafa) to the current version 7.1 from the 7.05 I was previously running. As always I do my due diligence of reading the release notes, update guide etc. Lucky for me I did and took a full backup of the mail database! Running through the notes it tells you to do certain steps at certain times, and of course being on Debian it uses dpkg to install the locally held packages you receive as part of the Zarafa distribution. Well this is usually all well and good, doing the installs and following the notes is generally not an issue, they have been in the past very good.</p>

<p>This time, they have split up certain functionality into other modules, one of which needs a new package to be installed which is NOT referenced in the upgrade guide anywhere. Of course me being me I googled it and found that I needed to add a certain source to my sources.list file. Well that was mistake number one! The source I added just happened to be the new Debian distribution "sid", I didn't realise this until WAY too late, after updating umpteen packages and suddenly finding that I needed to have a newer kernel installed to support libc6, oops!</p>

<p>So some quick investigation shows that I can get a new VPS with my current hosting company and it will support a) custom kernels, b) Debian 6.0 and future releases and c) it is faster, and more well appointed. The catch, it costs an extra $50 a year, big whoopie, and I have to migrate everything and set it back up. I go through the trouble of setting it up and use the same sources.list I used previously, with the exception of Debian 6.0 sources instead of Debian 5.0 sources, but of course I hadn't clicked that the "sid" source was a new distribution/version yet. So go through most of the setup and then realise that I've screwed the pooch. Start again, this time knowing what I've done wrong.</p>

<p>Now installing Zarafa 7.1 I find I still need that same package, but where will I get it? ... Oh come on, seriously, it was included in the distribution all along? So did I go through all this trouble for naught? Well yes and no. Yes because I did extra work I didn't need to do and spent money I really didn't need to, and things would have kept running away for a while. No because I did need to update to a later version of Debian as 5.0 is pretty much unsupported and I need to keep on top of security patches etc and of course the new VPS is quite speedy in comparison!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>After our last vacation to Hawaii we were all set to continue the yearly tradition (as it has become) and head back there again next year for our annual vacation.</p></p>

<p>As usual when we talk about things Vicki and I always come up with new ideas and of course we (by this I mean Vicki) raised an option of visiting the USA during Halloween, that is around October 31st. Which of course is right in the middle of a school term and at the end of month for Vicki's new job. As Braden is only in Grade 2 next year we thought that as long as we take some work with us he can keep mostly up to date with what is going on, after all homework is not all that time consuming or difficult. Vicki checked with her new work and they are flexible so the dates are mostly set.</p>

<p>However, the location was not. With every good intention of returning to Hawaii in mind other events have since changed the destination for some very valid reasons. You see we have each applied for entry into the Diversity Visa Lottery, or more commonly known as the Green Card lottery that the US Department of State holds each year. The results of this lottery will be available in May 2013 with entry into the United States in 2014. With this in mind and of course our initial decision to move to Pittsburgh, PA we decided it would probably be a good idea to visit and scout around the area to see if we actually like it and could see ourselves settling there for the long term.</p>

<p>Instead of a pretty relaxing vacation to Hawaii we are now looking at something a little more hectic with a trip to Pittsburgh. Of course getting there is the first issue, wanting to limit the number of flights we need to take is a priority, it seems that BNE to PIT is not the easiest of routes. We can go BNE - SYD - SFO - PIT or BNE - LAX - DFW - PIT or BNE - LAX - SFO - PIT and so forth, what we'd really like to do is BNE - SFO - PIT as this gives us an option to spend a day or two in San Francisco which we've only visited for the day previously.</p>

<p>But flights aside, the things to do in Pittsburgh are suddenly increasing, there is of course NHL game(s) to attend, assuming the lockout is over and done with by then! Then of course there should be NFL games on as well, seeings as Braden took a shine to NFL when we were in Hawaii. There will be no MLB on at that time though, unless of course the Buccos surprise every one and make the post season, come on it is possible, they had a great run this year, but couldn't keep up the pace. A visit to Southpointe to see the Penguins practice will be awesome almost as much as watching them play. Then of course we cannot forget all the looking around, eating and Halloween, although on the last item we do need to find somewhere "family" friendly where we can take Braden trick-or-treating.</p>

<p>To say I am excited about this next vacation is an understatement, I am super excited and have even petitioned some people on Twitter I follow for recommendations!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>But it feels like work sometimes. Having to think of a subject rather than just rambling on about nothing at all does seem a little tedious at times. Perhaps I am not cut out to be a blogger, probably why I am an I.T. Geek instead, although calling me a geek is a little bit of a misconception as I am a little above that pay-grade!</p></p>

<p>However I am digressing! When I re-vamped this blog I had all the good intentions of writing about things everyday, when in reality instead of picking subjects with substance (or not) I should have been concentrating on what the family was up to and writing things about us ... now that makes much more sense.</p>

<p>So what to write about from a family perspective for my first post back after such a long time away, yes, yes I know not as long as last time!</p>

<p>What have we done? Nothing? No, not really. Where have we been? Every where, well again, not really ...</p>

<p>Since July we've been the usual family trying to make life as enjoyable as possible, nothing out of the ordinary there really. Braden started playing ice hockey at the Gold Coast rink in the KRL, no not that mob-run (allegedly) league in Russia, but the Kids Recreational League. It is made up of three teams who play two weeks in a row and then have a bye, they have enough players to make two lines, one of older/bigger kids and the other of younger/smaller kids. The skill levels vary a great deal from those that can't really skate to those that have played at a state level. It is well run and Braden is really learning to play well, when it is not "too tired" that is.</p>

<p>So far he has only had one assist, not bad considering he doesn't really get into the action too much and likes to hang back, but he has also had a third and first star of the game. The third star was an encouragement award, but the first star was deserved. He played his best game ever that weekend, he was in on the plays, up and down the ice, making a supreme effort, happily staying on the ice and just doing a really good job overall. To say we were proud is an understatement.</p>

<p>Vicki and I have not been as active as we should be, but fingers crossed that will be changing soon with the startup of the development league, or C-grade. Where games will be run as a training/scrimmage session to allow us to get to know the positions, the rules and what is expected of us on the ice. This is to get us ready to move to B-grade for the next regular season, mainly because there were some "issues" with the season just completed, where new players were "inserted" into pre-existing teams and the outcome was not what I call friendly at all. The new league starts up in just over a week so we need to get signed up and ready to go, pretty excited about it actually!</p>

<figcaption>Waiting for the Pink Line bus to go to Ala Moana.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Our life has not just been ice hockey, we've just recently come back from a vacation to the Hawaiian Islands, and this time I can really say that as we didn't just spend time on Oahu, we went to Hawai'i itself as well (also know as the Big Island) and spent a week there. Besides the abysmal attempt at customer service by both QANTAS and Jetstar airlines we made it there and back safely, in the end. Suffice it to say we will NEVER book a flight through one airline where some legs may be by another carrier, it just ends up with far too much finger pointing and a complete lack of professionalism on either parties behalf.</p>

<p>The vacation though was excellent, we had the best time and returned with many great memories, and photos. I will have to figure out if I can link to a shared photo stream or if I have to add photos here individually, only time will tell. I will write more detailed posts on some of the things that we did while on both islands as it is far too much for a single post (not to mention giving me subject matter that will span weeks instead of days ... oops I shouldn't readily admit that should I?).</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="/assets/img/img_0129.jpg" alt="Great view of Waikiki Beach"/>
<figcaption>The view from the hotel room was spectacular.</figcaption></figure>

<p>As with all vacations it is always sad to have to come home, this time especially as Vicki didn't have a job to come back to after being "let go" due to financial re-structuring at her last job. It was a shame as she loved the company, the staff and the job, although I think the hardest part was leaving her friends behind who have more work to do to fill the gaps. On the bright side though she did find a new job in record time and the hours are now "school hours" which means she starts at 8:30am and finishes at 3:00pm daily, which means I do not have to pick up Braden every afternoon from school, although I could if I wanted to and will in situations where Vicki has to work back.</p>

<p>One thing the vacation has done is re-affirmed our desire to move to the United States of America, to that end we've both entered the Diversity Lottery (Green Card Lottery) for entry in 2014 as a fall back in case I cannot organise something else. The wonderful, yes sarcasm, thing is that we put our entry into the lottery in October but do not find out until May, and then have to wait for the next round of steps before getting the card in 2014. Patience is not really one of my virtues to be entirely honest!</p></section>
