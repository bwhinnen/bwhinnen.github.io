          <p><section><p>What is going on here? Brett suddenly posting again? Yes! I've been lazy far too long now, I blame a distinct lack of motivation and pressure of trying to think of a new subject everyday. To me that smacks of a lack of commitment more than anything but I'll stick with my lazy excuse.</p></p>

<p>So the Devils made the Stanley Cup playoffs, they lost unfortunately, I would have loved to see them win, and given Parise's move to Minnesota it would have been a great ending to his Devils career. I also think that Brodeur would have retired if they won the cup, mind you I am happy to see both him and Johan back in the line up for next year.</p>

<p>I'm still a little shocked that Staal decided that he wanted to move, I can't blame him when looking at it from a perspective of the number of top line players the Pens have and of course the chance to play with his brother and all, but come on I really liked the dynamics of the Pens last season. Mind you I cannot wait for the new season to see just how they go, mind you I still think they should have traded Martin rather than Michalek, but who am I?</p>

<p>The Red Sox have been playing luke warm, more colder than hot. The Pirates on the other hand have been playing amazingly, it must be the awesomeness of Zoltan!</p>

<p>We've been doing pretty much the same around here, ice skating, ice hockey and all. Both Vicki and Braden have celebrated their birthdays in the last week. Vicki was sick for hers which meant we didn't do a great deal, but Braden and I still took her out to dinner to celebrate. Braden spent the day at the ice rink,no party, just a nice cake amongst friends and family, he was quite chuffed when he got to kiss Steph (his 'older' girlfriend) on the cheek.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>And all kinds! We had another training session on Thursday night just gone. It really is a great deal of fun and I am starting to feel better skating around with a stick now, which is good. This was my second training session and Vicki's third as she got to train with the women's team last weekend. She is still a much better skater than me, and probably will be for a long time, but I tend to be a bit better at the things that require strength, such as jumping etc, and that is not surprising, but it is only a matter of time before her skills take over Â on that, so give me my short lived something better than her! Not that it makes all that much difference in the long term though, as long as we all have fun.</p></p>

<p>Braden also joined us for most of the training session as the juniors were doing some advanced work and there was no one else his age or skill level there. I think he got a little bored with us, but still did what he was told which is always good, I made one of the last things we did a game for him which helped.</p>

<p>I can't speak for Vicki but having all the gear on is giving me some confidence, I am doing things that I would not normally do without it on, that is a good thing as it is also translating across to skating without gear. Why? Because I realise I can do it without falling over and then continue to do it without the gear, which only advances my skating further. As an example this morning was skate school and I was much more confident with my outside edge drills and feel a little more in control of what I am doing, especially when the edge starts to slip because I am not placing enough weight on the edge.</p>

<p>Today has been a great day for relaxing at home, we've watched the last three games of the Devils versus Rangers Eastern Conference Finals even though we already know the scores and outcome. It has been good watching, although seeing in person just how often the Devils lost a commanding lead was a little scary.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be a day of just relaxing skating, although I'll be trying to improve some newly learnt skills and really should be doing more backwards and transition practice. We will see, I am also in two minds on wearing my shin pads / hockey pants combination on the ice, but think I might just use these sessions for basic training and fun to ensure that I still keep the enjoyment of just skating around.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>That I am. My excuse is that I've been sick and not feeling like doing much at all. A "friend" referred to it as the Man Flu, I tell you it was not said version of the flu, it was the full blown thing, not that it incapacitated me but I was feeling rather weary and had a distinct lack of motivation and energy.</p></p>

<p>I am still not at 100%, heck I'm not really at 70%, but I will still be heading to hockey practice tonight as I want to get out and who knows some exercise in really cold conditions might be good for me?!?! Yeah I know silly, but I don't want to miss practice! Speaking of which with Vicki's mum down here last weekend and me being sick early this week I've not been on the ice since Saturday morning and am really missing it and know I will feel a bit wobblier than usual when I get on tonight. But it is all for a good cause.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went into the office to work, of course there was an ulterior motive, I wanted to drop into Skatebiz to try on a size 9 skate in the Easton line up, which I did. Unfortunately they were as pre-thought, too small. Only just though, I'd say I would get away with a 1/4 size up from that, but not to worry, I have a set of 9.5D Easton EQ50's on order, yes the very same skates that I am sure Vicki will kill be for buying, but I don't care! Mind you I think it will be at least four weeks before they get here ... Of course I am getting a pretty good deal on them too so I am not overly concerned, my trusty EQ10's will do until then.</p>

<p>I am also a little disillusioned with the Speech Pathologist that Braden sees on a weekly basis. She did a report up detailing where he is up to so we can look to get some further assistance in the class room. The report was nothing out of the ordinary, but she put a comment on the bottom to call if we want to discuss, well I did, and I did call, only to leave a voice message. Which I did clearly, I also rang form my mobile phone which does not hide the number. That was a week ago now, and she still has not called back, I am not the happiest camper out there at the moment, not in the slightest. Given her report I would have thought that she would be working on more than just 's' or 'r' pronunciation and start working on structure and the correct use of words, but no, she still insists on this rubbish while a good thing does not help Braden to communicate! A lisp or a 'w' sound to some letters does not cause problems with communication like not being able to fully express himself!</p></section>
