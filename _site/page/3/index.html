          <p><section><p>After our last vacation to Hawaii we were all set to continue the yearly tradition (as it has become) and head back there again next year for our annual vacation.</p></p>

<p>As usual when we talk about things Vicki and I always come up with new ideas and of course we (by this I mean Vicki) raised an option of visiting the USA during Halloween, that is around October 31st. Which of course is right in the middle of a school term and at the end of month for Vicki's new job. As Braden is only in Grade 2 next year we thought that as long as we take some work with us he can keep mostly up to date with what is going on, after all homework is not all that time consuming or difficult. Vicki checked with her new work and they are flexible so the dates are mostly set.</p>

<p>However, the location was not. With every good intention of returning to Hawaii in mind other events have since changed the destination for some very valid reasons. You see we have each applied for entry into the Diversity Visa Lottery, or more commonly known as the Green Card lottery that the US Department of State holds each year. The results of this lottery will be available in May 2013 with entry into the United States in 2014. With this in mind and of course our initial decision to move to Pittsburgh, PA we decided it would probably be a good idea to visit and scout around the area to see if we actually like it and could see ourselves settling there for the long term.</p>

<p>Instead of a pretty relaxing vacation to Hawaii we are now looking at something a little more hectic with a trip to Pittsburgh. Of course getting there is the first issue, wanting to limit the number of flights we need to take is a priority, it seems that BNE to PIT is not the easiest of routes. We can go BNE - SYD - SFO - PIT or BNE - LAX - DFW - PIT or BNE - LAX - SFO - PIT and so forth, what we'd really like to do is BNE - SFO - PIT as this gives us an option to spend a day or two in San Francisco which we've only visited for the day previously.</p>

<p>But flights aside, the things to do in Pittsburgh are suddenly increasing, there is of course NHL game(s) to attend, assuming the lockout is over and done with by then! Then of course there should be NFL games on as well, seeings as Braden took a shine to NFL when we were in Hawaii. There will be no MLB on at that time though, unless of course the Buccos surprise every one and make the post season, come on it is possible, they had a great run this year, but couldn't keep up the pace. A visit to Southpointe to see the Penguins practice will be awesome almost as much as watching them play. Then of course we cannot forget all the looking around, eating and Halloween, although on the last item we do need to find somewhere "family" friendly where we can take Braden trick-or-treating.</p>

<p>To say I am excited about this next vacation is an understatement, I am super excited and have even petitioned some people on Twitter I follow for recommendations!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>But it feels like work sometimes. Having to think of a subject rather than just rambling on about nothing at all does seem a little tedious at times. Perhaps I am not cut out to be a blogger, probably why I am an I.T. Geek instead, although calling me a geek is a little bit of a misconception as I am a little above that pay-grade!</p></p>

<p>However I am digressing! When I re-vamped this blog I had all the good intentions of writing about things everyday, when in reality instead of picking subjects with substance (or not) I should have been concentrating on what the family was up to and writing things about us ... now that makes much more sense.</p>

<p>So what to write about from a family perspective for my first post back after such a long time away, yes, yes I know not as long as last time!</p>

<p>What have we done? Nothing? No, not really. Where have we been? Every where, well again, not really ...</p>

<p>Since July we've been the usual family trying to make life as enjoyable as possible, nothing out of the ordinary there really. Braden started playing ice hockey at the Gold Coast rink in the KRL, no not that mob-run (allegedly) league in Russia, but the Kids Recreational League. It is made up of three teams who play two weeks in a row and then have a bye, they have enough players to make two lines, one of older/bigger kids and the other of younger/smaller kids. The skill levels vary a great deal from those that can't really skate to those that have played at a state level. It is well run and Braden is really learning to play well, when it is not "too tired" that is.</p>

<p>So far he has only had one assist, not bad considering he doesn't really get into the action too much and likes to hang back, but he has also had a third and first star of the game. The third star was an encouragement award, but the first star was deserved. He played his best game ever that weekend, he was in on the plays, up and down the ice, making a supreme effort, happily staying on the ice and just doing a really good job overall. To say we were proud is an understatement.</p>

<p>Vicki and I have not been as active as we should be, but fingers crossed that will be changing soon with the startup of the development league, or C-grade. Where games will be run as a training/scrimmage session to allow us to get to know the positions, the rules and what is expected of us on the ice. This is to get us ready to move to B-grade for the next regular season, mainly because there were some "issues" with the season just completed, where new players were "inserted" into pre-existing teams and the outcome was not what I call friendly at all. The new league starts up in just over a week so we need to get signed up and ready to go, pretty excited about it actually!</p>

<p>Our life has not just been ice hockey, we've just recently come back from a vacation to the Hawaiian Islands, and this time I can really say that as we didn't just spend time on Oahu, we went to Hawai'i itself as well (also know as the Big Island) and spent a week there. Besides the abysmal attempt at customer service by both QANTAS and Jetstar airlines we made it there and back safely, in the end. Suffice it to say we will NEVER book a flight through one airline where some legs may be by another carrier, it just ends up with far too much finger pointing and a complete lack of professionalism on either parties behalf.</p>

<p>The vacation though was excellent, we had the best time and returned with many great memories, and photos. I will have to figure out if I can link to a shared photo stream or if I have to add photos here individually, only time will tell. I will write more detailed posts on some of the things that we did while on both islands as it is far too much for a single post (not to mention giving me subject matter that will span weeks instead of days ... oops I shouldn't readily admit that should I?).</p>

<figure class="center"><img src="/assets/img/img_0129.jpg" alt="Great view of Waikiki Beach"/>
<figcaption>The view from the hotel room was spectacular.</figcaption></figure>

<p>As with all vacations it is always sad to have to come home, this time especially as Vicki didn't have a job to come back to after being "let go" due to financial re-structuring at her last job. It was a shame as she loved the company, the staff and the job, although I think the hardest part was leaving her friends behind who have more work to do to fill the gaps. On the bright side though she did find a new job in record time and the hours are now "school hours" which means she starts at 8:30am and finishes at 3:00pm daily, which means I do not have to pick up Braden every afternoon from school, although I could if I wanted to and will in situations where Vicki has to work back.</p>

<p>One thing the vacation has done is re-affirmed our desire to move to the United States of America, to that end we've both entered the Diversity Lottery (Green Card Lottery) for entry in 2014 as a fall back in case I cannot organise something else. The wonderful, yes sarcasm, thing is that we put our entry into the lottery in October but do not find out until May, and then have to wait for the next round of steps before getting the card in 2014. Patience is not really one of my virtues to be entirely honest!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>What is going on here? Brett suddenly posting again? Yes! I've been lazy far too long now, I blame a distinct lack of motivation and pressure of trying to think of a new subject everyday. To me that smacks of a lack of commitment more than anything but I'll stick with my lazy excuse.</p></p>

<p>So the Devils made the Stanley Cup playoffs, they lost unfortunately, I would have loved to see them win, and given Parise's move to Minnesota it would have been a great ending to his Devils career. I also think that Brodeur would have retired if they won the cup, mind you I am happy to see both him and Johan back in the line up for next year.</p>

<p>I'm still a little shocked that Staal decided that he wanted to move, I can't blame him when looking at it from a perspective of the number of top line players the Pens have and of course the chance to play with his brother and all, but come on I really liked the dynamics of the Pens last season. Mind you I cannot wait for the new season to see just how they go, mind you I still think they should have traded Martin rather than Michalek, but who am I?</p>

<p>The Red Sox have been playing luke warm, more colder than hot. The Pirates on the other hand have been playing amazingly, it must be the awesomeness of Zoltan!</p>

<p>We've been doing pretty much the same around here, ice skating, ice hockey and all. Both Vicki and Braden have celebrated their birthdays in the last week. Vicki was sick for hers which meant we didn't do a great deal, but Braden and I still took her out to dinner to celebrate. Braden spent the day at the ice rink,no party, just a nice cake amongst friends and family, he was quite chuffed when he got to kiss Steph (his 'older' girlfriend) on the cheek.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>And all kinds! We had another training session on Thursday night just gone. It really is a great deal of fun and I am starting to feel better skating around with a stick now, which is good. This was my second training session and Vicki's third as she got to train with the women's team last weekend. She is still a much better skater than me, and probably will be for a long time, but I tend to be a bit better at the things that require strength, such as jumping etc, and that is not surprising, but it is only a matter of time before her skills take over  on that, so give me my short lived something better than her! Not that it makes all that much difference in the long term though, as long as we all have fun.</p></p>

<p>Braden also joined us for most of the training session as the juniors were doing some advanced work and there was no one else his age or skill level there. I think he got a little bored with us, but still did what he was told which is always good, I made one of the last things we did a game for him which helped.</p>

<p>I can't speak for Vicki but having all the gear on is giving me some confidence, I am doing things that I would not normally do without it on, that is a good thing as it is also translating across to skating without gear. Why? Because I realise I can do it without falling over and then continue to do it without the gear, which only advances my skating further. As an example this morning was skate school and I was much more confident with my outside edge drills and feel a little more in control of what I am doing, especially when the edge starts to slip because I am not placing enough weight on the edge.</p>

<p>Today has been a great day for relaxing at home, we've watched the last three games of the Devils versus Rangers Eastern Conference Finals even though we already know the scores and outcome. It has been good watching, although seeing in person just how often the Devils lost a commanding lead was a little scary.</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be a day of just relaxing skating, although I'll be trying to improve some newly learnt skills and really should be doing more backwards and transition practice. We will see, I am also in two minds on wearing my shin pads / hockey pants combination on the ice, but think I might just use these sessions for basic training and fun to ensure that I still keep the enjoyment of just skating around.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>That I am. My excuse is that I've been sick and not feeling like doing much at all. A "friend" referred to it as the Man Flu, I tell you it was not said version of the flu, it was the full blown thing, not that it incapacitated me but I was feeling rather weary and had a distinct lack of motivation and energy.</p></p>

<p>I am still not at 100%, heck I'm not really at 70%, but I will still be heading to hockey practice tonight as I want to get out and who knows some exercise in really cold conditions might be good for me?!?! Yeah I know silly, but I don't want to miss practice! Speaking of which with Vicki's mum down here last weekend and me being sick early this week I've not been on the ice since Saturday morning and am really missing it and know I will feel a bit wobblier than usual when I get on tonight. But it is all for a good cause.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went into the office to work, of course there was an ulterior motive, I wanted to drop into Skatebiz to try on a size 9 skate in the Easton line up, which I did. Unfortunately they were as pre-thought, too small. Only just though, I'd say I would get away with a 1/4 size up from that, but not to worry, I have a set of 9.5D Easton EQ50's on order, yes the very same skates that I am sure Vicki will kill be for buying, but I don't care! Mind you I think it will be at least four weeks before they get here ... Of course I am getting a pretty good deal on them too so I am not overly concerned, my trusty EQ10's will do until then.</p>

<p>I am also a little disillusioned with the Speech Pathologist that Braden sees on a weekly basis. She did a report up detailing where he is up to so we can look to get some further assistance in the class room. The report was nothing out of the ordinary, but she put a comment on the bottom to call if we want to discuss, well I did, and I did call, only to leave a voice message. Which I did clearly, I also rang form my mobile phone which does not hide the number. That was a week ago now, and she still has not called back, I am not the happiest camper out there at the moment, not in the slightest. Given her report I would have thought that she would be working on more than just 's' or 'r' pronunciation and start working on structure and the correct use of words, but no, she still insists on this rubbish while a good thing does not help Braden to communicate! A lisp or a 'w' sound to some letters does not cause problems with communication like not being able to fully express himself!</p></section>
