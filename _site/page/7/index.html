          <p><section><p>This is a bit of a post to encompass both yesterday and today! Why? Because the inter-webs is broken, well today I am accessing it tethered to my iPhone which really reminds me of the slower speeds we used to receive when dial-up was the only affordable connection method.</p></p>

<p>Yesterday I had to head into the office and it was a busy day with cases, not to mention the hour and three quarters spent in the car getting to and from the office. I makes for a long day on its own without taking into consideration a hefty case load as well or of course the 50 million questions you get because of the novelty of having one of the senior support staff actually in the office! I think I spent around an hour and a half discussing problems, configs and solutions with various account team members and engineers. It is good for them though as they don't often get to speak to a so-called subject matter expert (well I am supposed to be one of them!).</p>

<p>This morning the Telco Field Service Engineer arrived at my home to look at my connection, sadly he shook his head and muttered about other calls in my area for the same issues. It seems that there is a problem in the area related to the actual network (or should I say NOT-work) and upstream synchronisation. Usually I have this problem when the outdoor cable splitter is corroded, but since they replaced my cable run from the street a few years ago that hasn't been happening so no quick fix this time.</p>

<p>So here I sit with my Mac Pro connected to my iPhone for inter-webs and my work laptop connected to the dill-berry (BlackBerry) for work inter-webs with a sick boy sitting in the lounge room watching TV hoping that I do not need to go into the office today. Although I know Braden will love the adventure of going into the city and my work as he always does.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>It was an advert from the 90's I think, or it could have even been from the 80's I can't quite remember. Nor can I remember the actual item they were advertising! But that proverb has pretty much summed up my last couple of days at work. Usually I finish up around the time I am supposed to but the last couple of days I've gone an hour over time, and today I had to leave work for tomorrow which I absolutely hate doing. But enough of work :)</p></p>

<p>Last night was a skating night, and great night it was, relatively quiet night and room to move and have a bit of fun. For me it was just a night for skating around rather than trying new things or practising for skate school. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the night and the hour and a half on the ice after the day I had yesterday. It seems that for me ice skating is just a nice relaxing thing to do, I just wish it wasn't so expensive so I could do more of it!</p>

<p>Braden of course did his usual and picked up a few girls, and I say girls I mean girls in their mid to late teens, they just seem drawn to him. He is pretty smug about it too when we ask him about his 'girlfriends' :) Vicki was asked if she wanted to join the women's ice hockey team and training sessions, and I think she will as well, which will be awesome for her, except it will probably mean she gets further and further ahead of me in skill level :) But I think it was really nice of them to ask her.</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Seriously, are we that caught up in our own little lives that we cannot accept others are different in some way? Context you say, yes that will help. This morning Hayley Williams from Paramore re-tweeted something from HumanRightsCampaign about three bills that are about to be passed in Tennessee and seriously WTF is that all about?</p></p>

<figure class="center"><img src="/assets/img/screen-shot-2012-05-01-at-10-14-06-am.png" alt="HRC Tweet"/>
<figcaption>HRC Tweet that started the ball rolling for me.</figcaption></figure>

<p> Looking at this the one that they are most concerned with at the moment is that elementary and middle schools would not even acknowledge any relationship other than heterosexual exists, so no gay relationships. I have an issue with this on two levels, elementary school level children should not really be exposed to the sexuality of a relationship at all and of course the primary issue that many activists have; how will this alienate a child who's parents are in a gay relationship. I mean come on people with the amount of bullying and segregation over any little difference out there today you want to add fuel to the fire that is anti-same sex relationships? You are doing more damage to the kids than you are doing to the adults in this case and that is not fair!</p>

<p>One of the other bills that is due to go through is one on bullying. Saying that it is OK to bully someone if it was a reflection of their ‘religious, philosophical, or political views;’. Seriously, you want to give kids the right to bully now? You may as well just hand them all clubs, dress them in half cured animal skins and let them go at it! That is how bad this bill is. It is bad enough at the moment that there are religious zealots out there who refuse to accept anything other than their own doctrine, unable to accept that others may differ and have vastly conflicting beliefs, but to put this religious bigotry to law? The second point, philosophical, well anyone who is philosophical in nature should be able to work around differences by virtue so that should not ever come into the equation, however this now gives the un-educated yet another avenue to bully.</p>

<p>I don't know how politics work in the USA at the moment, but here in Australia rather than advertising the plans, promises and agendas of a political party they now personally attack the opposition. This bullying already occurs in the adult world and is grossly passed off as 'political lobbying', bollox I say to that, it is cheap shots of people who should not be running for any level of Government. These people cannot function in a normal society, instead they turn to politics to satisfy a self inflated ego and belief that they are better than everyone else. The unfortunate thing is that if there were such a concept as an honest politician they wouldn't survive anyway, and thus the self-centred, bureaucratic jagoffs end up getting voted in by an equally un-educated population. In effect this bill will just allow this purely political bullying to now legally move into the younger and more impressionable generations. Disgusting!</p>

<p>The third bill is not one I have read up on much nor understand, but it revolves around the fact that parents must give permission before their children can join a club at school. It also states that the only available clubs will be in the students handbook. This could reflect that any club that does not fit into what the school would base as good and wholesome as unacceptable and therefore 'evil'. I can't comment too much on this one as we never had clubs at school where I went.</p>

<p>All in all I think society is really screwing it up for the younger generation, the do-gooders out there think they are doing the right thing. This really irks me as it is akin to the whole every student wins a prize and there are no second places, which is absolute rubbish and gives the kids a false sense of how the world works. There are winners and losers in this world and kids need to learn that they will not always win, but should always try their best and of course on the flip side they should always be gracious in winning and offer assistance to those that do not.</p>

<p>Really kids need to be taught tolerance, empathy and above all must learn that change is not a bad thing! Change is a part of our lives and we must learn to accept it and work with it and understand that we can always turn it to our or others advantages.</p></section>
