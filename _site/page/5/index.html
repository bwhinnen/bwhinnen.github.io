          <p><section><p>Who knew? Not me, and definitely not Vicki. Three hockey bags full of equipment, three sticks, one adult length, one intermediate, and one junior as well as plenty of room for all of us three. I thought I'd fit it in there, but was amazed at just how much room there is in such a small little car. Of course if we were a bigger family it never would do and we'd have to get the roof rack Vicki was thinking.</p></p>

<p>I am very glad that everything fits in the car as I didn't want to have to buy more stuff just to get to and from hockey, nor did I want to have to drive two cars as it would cost us a fortune in tolls!</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the day Vicki and I take to the ice for the first time in full hockey equipment, it is going to be rather interesting and I for one will probably get little sleep tonight just thinking about it.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>And it is only Tuesday.</p></p>

<p>Strange I know, but for some reason I've not been sleeping well of late, I think my brain is just still too active, thinking and thinking. It happens when work is busy and I have a few 'interesting' cases, unfortunately I'm one of those people that keep thinking about things as I tend to have a few <em>lightbulb</em> moments out of work hours.</p>

<p>The other thing keeping me up last night was making sure I woke up early enough to go and fill up my car with petrol/gas and get ready to take Braden to school and head into the office. Yes there was an ulterior motive, I went into town to pick up the helmets for Vicki and myself and also get all of our skates sharpened. It was great to have a chat to Kirk, although he was very busy unfortunately as he was down a couple of guys today. I hope his day raced by though. Vicki has a shiny new black Easton helmet with a full face cage and I have a mostly shiny new white Easton helmet with a visor. I just couldn't live with the full cage as the padded chin strap kept digging into my adams apple. They are all sized up correctly now and we are ready to start training on Thursday. Although we still need to learn how to get dressed properly.</p>

<p>There really isn't any other news of worth at the moment, we are all pretty quiet at home and even skipped the cheap skate night tonight as we are all feeling rather tired and a little run down.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Too many things this week!</p></p>

<p>First one is the count down to donning the hockey gear and getting on the ice to learn how to play ice hockey. This is going to be a most interesting experience! I've already expressed some apprehension as sometimes I feel like all left feet when on the ice, but I think this will ultimately make me a much better skater. Then again, speaking to the development coach (Matt) yesterday gave me a little insight to some of the things we will be doing. One such thing was to skate on one leg, and then bend that leg and straighten etc, this is to improve a) leg strength and b) balance. I thought to myself , gee I can't even do that while standing in sneakers, how am I going to do that on the ice, on skates! I tried it, and you know what, I could actually do it, on both legs I was quite shocked, but I tell you it does put some strain on your quads, but in a good way. So yesterday was spent trying a few things out, mucking around and then the best bit, getting the remainder of the hockey equipment to borrow for both Vicki and I. It was good to have everything, although the only pants they really had in my size were bright red and extremely heavy. I opted for a pair a little smaller to get me by, but I tell you what if I had of worn the other pants I think I'd be able to stand in front of a nuclear blast and not feel a thing on my thighs!</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be the day I go into Skatebiz and pick up our helmets, looking forward to that bit. I'll also be taking four pairs of skates in for sharpening, yes you heard me right: four! No we've not got a new member to the family or skating family, Vicki couldn't pass up a deal yesterday, a pair of near new Graf skates for $80, skates that retail for $200. They are in pretty good condition and Vicki will use them as her ice hockey skates as they are one size (Euro sizing) smaller than her current ones and fit that little bit snugger. I still want to get some new skates, but really cannot justify the $500+ for a new pair of skates that will last me a long time, now if I could sell my old ones I'd seriously think about it, mind you Vicki would kill me, seriously kill me, as in dead, I'm sure she'd stab me in the middle of the night with those $500 skates! So they can wait for a while, or I'll use my own money to buy them instead of dipping into the ice hockey funding.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Rangers and the Caps played game seven of their series, and the Rangers came out on top, not even an overtime game at that! That means that the Devils will now play the Rangers for the Conference finals, and the winner will head to the Stanley Cup finals. I am rooting for the Devils on this one, and really hope they keep up the level headedness they have shown during the last games against the Flyers. The Eastern Conference finals start today, and the first game between the Kings and the Coyotes is underway, I am not looking at the scores as I would like to watch the game without knowing the score (just for once). Everybody is saying the Kings are on fire, and are going to blitz the Coyotes, I think the Kings have peaked while the other teams have been on a downward spiral, but the Coyotes have also picked up their game as well. For me I want the Coyotes to advance and to knock the Kings off of their pedestal. We shall soon see in the next four to seven games who will come out on top.</p>

<p>Yesterday was also Mother's Day across the world, Braden and I let Vicki decide what she wanted to do and of course she picked ice skating, which neither of us mind at all. I gave Braden some money on Friday to visit the Mother's Day stall at school so he could pick out a present for Vicki. He ended up choosing a nice little jar of Vanilla Bath Salts, I am not sure how he realised she loved Vanilla, but he did well and Vicki was very happy with it. Braden and I got her a Devils jersey for Mother's Day, although it was supposed to be for her Birthday! It was customised with her favourite player, Zach Parise, and she absolutely loves it, she wore it skating yesterday and was very proud of it.</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Is going on with the Red Sox at the moment? I mean seriously what is going on? They have less than a .500 rating at the moment and are really playing hot and very very cold. This is the worst I have seen them play early in the season since starting to follow them. It seems that every time I look at the MLB website I see a loss, very sad. I am beginning to wonder if the loss of Varitek is such a missing piece.</p></p>

<p>The other thing is it seems that the NHL Season is winding down, where we would have at least a game a night to watch now there is lucky to be two or three a week which is pretty disappointing. I can now see why people get withdrawals from their favourite sports during the off season. The Caps and the Rangers play again on Sunday our time and I think it will be an absolute brilliant hard fought game! Then and finally then round 3 of the Stanley Cup finals can begin!</p>

<p>I am actually very glad it is the weekend, it has been a very long week and a very busy one at that. The other person that does what I do at work for the entire APAC region was overseas for the start of the week which meant I was holding the APAC timezone on my own. A couple of completely crappy days were had and thankfully the case load wasn't as high as it could have been.</p></section>
