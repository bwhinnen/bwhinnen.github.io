<p>The customer was very happy to hear that we knew what the issue was and that we were doing things to alleviate the issue. It was a good call to be involved on and even though I was dragged in so to speak I was glad to be the one that could help the customer. Now I hope we can get to the bottom of things with the third party vendor!</p></section>

          <p><section></p>Is going on with the Red Sox at the moment? I mean seriously what is going on? They have less than a .500 rating at the moment and are really playing hot and very very cold. This is the worst I have seen them play early in the season since starting to follow them. It seems that every time I look at the MLB website I see a loss, very sad. I am beginning to wonder if the loss of Varitek is such a missing piece.</p></p>

<p>The other thing is it seems that the NHL Season is winding down, where we would have at least a game a night to watch now there is lucky to be two or three a week which is pretty disappointing. I can now see why people get withdrawals from their favourite sports during the off season. The Caps and the Rangers play again on Sunday our time and I think it will be an absolute brilliant hard fought game! Then and finally then round 3 of the Stanley Cup finals can begin!</p>

<p>I am actually very glad it is the weekend, it has been a very long week and a very busy one at that. The other person that does what I do at work for the entire APAC region was overseas for the start of the week which meant I was holding the APAC timezone on my own. A couple of completely crappy days were had and thankfully the case load wasn't as high as it could have been.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I don't know how I manage to do it or why I do it to myself. I somehow seem to get dragged into things at work that really I shouldn't be. There should be an entire level or two between me and the need to be customer facing for some things. In this instance I'm the developer of a software solution at work (not my usual role but something I took over about five or six years ago), I support the code, delivery kit, sales collateral, training etc in my spare time. A support case was opened and I have been called in to look at things and act as a liaison with another vendor, which is all fine and dandy, but rather than having the local support team involved with the customer they feel the need to pull me into the mix. Yes I can do it, but really, I should be working with the third party vendor on this only, the local teams, from account management, customer support, application support etc should be the ones fronting the meetings, not the developer.</p></p>

<p>Really do they want me in the meeting so I can say "See this single line of code ... this one small line where one variable is assigned the value from another? That is where it is failing." Do I know why? Well yes as a matter of fact I do know why, but I don't have the ability to work around it as I am reliant on that command working and there is no way to fork it off while we complete the rest of the logic flow. Crappy programming language, or sorry interpreted scripting language!</p>

<p>That was pretty much my evening unfortunately.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Today was Game 5 between the Devils and the Flyers, being played at the Wells Fargo Centre in Phildelphia. I say today but of course I am a day ahead of the USA so it was played on Tuesday night there of course. Now was it the re-introduction of Rinaldo, the loss of Giroux or the complete miss-handle by Bryzgalov that cost the Flyers the game? Or will they blame the very close offside call which resulted in a goal? Who really knows, but one thing we do know is that the Flyers fan-base really are a fickle bunch. Most of them booing their own team or leaving early. The few remaining fans actually cheering the team when they acknowledged the crowd at the end of their season.</p></p>

<p>Why did the Flyers lose in four straight games? Because the Devils (unlike the Pens) had a solid penalty kill and refused to play down at the Flyers level of retaliation play. Something other teams should really take on board for future meetings with them. In this game the Flyers were completely outclassed by a better team, a team that played as a team, that seemed to be everywhere on the ice at once (most of the time).</p>

<p>We currently have the Western Conference finals ready to go with the Kings and the Coyotes, which will prove to be an interesting series, the Kings have been dominating, but I really don't think either the Canucks or the Blues were playing at their best. The Coyotes have been playing hard but really did dominate the Preds. I'm going for the Coyotes on this one, purely because I don't like the City of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Eastern Conference still has three teams competing, the Devils have moved up, now it is between the Caps and the Rangers. Two rather interesting teams, two rather interesting sets of players and one coach that likes to whinge and whine a great deal, oh and of course drop the f-bomb more than me! Really I want the Rangers to win this one, but ultimately I don't think it matters as the Devils are the team I want to take the Conference finals and then step it up to the Cup!</p></section>

          <p><section><p>I've trademarked the title as it was coined by the great duo over at <a title="Hockey's Finest - girls who dig hockey!" href="http://hockeysfinest.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Hockey's Finest</a> and I think it is quite clever!</p></p>

<p>We've had a couple of what I term suspect hits over the last few days, the first being Ovechkin on Girardi. First view of that hit was "WTF Ovi!". I'm not Ovechkin's biggest fan, far from it, and he has displayed some rather poor judgement on hits in the past, but this was in my eyes blatant. He took a cursory swipe at the puck with his foot and then launched himself at Girardi, it looked to be a) leaving his feet and b) targeting the head. Looking at the slow motion video replays showed he hit shoulder to shoulder and that he may or may not of left his feet. I still think it was a targeted hit, so I guess the NHL are lucky it is not me who is in charge of player safety!! Shanahan decided that there was no malice to the hit, and that Girardi saw Ovechkin coming and there was no evidence of anything but a clean hit. I strike this up as a lucky one for Ovechkin. The hit and some analysis from the commentators below.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8myT-qqM0TI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Giroux of the Flyers on the other hand, the minute I saw the late hit on Zubrus I thought, Shanabanned for sure! Leading up to the play you could see Giroux was annoyed at the officials, some sources say it was on a play by Brodeur outside of the trapezoid, others say it was the clean hit by Fayne that may have set it off where Giroux thought it deserved more. All I saw was an angry and animated Giroux taking out his anger on the closest Devils player that had the puck (well had being the operative word). This is disgusting behaviour from any player in a professional sport! People get angry yes, people lash out yes, but to do it when you are in the game against someone who has nothing to do with things, when you know the risk of suspension is high and your team is facing elimination from the playoffs? Not a smart play. I thought Giroux wasn't mad from the typical Flyers mold, I now know I was gravely mistaken, with this play and also the whole breaking the stick over the goal posts in a loss to the Pens in Game 5 ...</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XiLVsiQzQ-E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This is not the first time Shanahan has suspended someone, and someone who is quite the influential player for a team, when that team is facing elimination. He did it with James Neal when he (Neal) really did some rather stupid plays, one of them against Giroux ironically. Really what Shanahan is showing here is that anger and retaliation has no place on the ice, going out and hitting someone illegally just to hurt them is not on when you are frustrated or angry! It really does show the wrong side of the sport to those youngsters who look up to these players!</p></section>
