          <p><section><p>We've had Vicki's mum down here for the weekend and it seems like it never stopped. Funnily enough, we didn't stop, Friday was just a night catching up, Saturday was skate school in the morning, followed by shopping at Chermside and some lunch and an hour or so relaxation at home before heading back out. Vicki got a message about women's hockey training that was to occur on Saturday night and we all convinced her that she should go, so she did.</p></p>

<p>I think she was a little shocked at how the training was run as it was a pretty full on warm up with the "Browns" who are an open age team with the near top echelon of players in Queensland (well some of them anyway). She had a great time though and made a few new friends as well I believe, which is always a good thing when doing something you enjoy.</p>

<p>This morning was then a very early start having junior hockey practice for Braden at Acacia Ridge Iceworld, which is now re-opened, FINALLY. They had one and a half hours on the ice this morning from 7:30am, the boy does have an upper respiratory infection that seems to be a little persistent, and a relatively busy weekend but still was a trooper trying his hardest out there and still had a great time, seeing his huge smile while he is doing things is just awesome!</p>

<p>But one problem with this hectic weekend we have all started to get sick, Braden with his persistent cough, and Vicki feeling run down and I've got the same as Braden, hoping it clears up quickly as I want to get out to hockey practice again, yes it was that much fun! So hopefully I'll be able to make an appointment to see the doctor tomorrow and make sure I nip this in the bud as soon as possible.</p><section>

          <p><section><p>Yes I should of posted yesterday, but we did not get home until almost 10pm after hockey practice and then by the time I'd finished hanging up the hockey gear to air out overnight and a shower it was 11pm! So suffice it to say I didn't have any time to post last night after hockey and today, what a day , it was shocking to say the least, busy, busy and then busy, just in case you didn't figure it out today was a busy day!</p></p>

<p>Back to hockey practice, in a word, AWESOME! We had such a great time and the hour really did go far too quickly, I think we spent almost as much time getting ready when you consider I had to dress Braden and then myself as well as undress us both after training finished. I've said it to friends, I have never felt so uncoordinated in my life, well with the exception of trying to ball-room dance just prior to getting married to Vicki. But I digress, it is hard enough to skate, then to add the hockey gear adds a little more difficulty, but trying to control a stick, and a puck while moving!! Holy crap that was difficult. I think I need some practice in just skating with a stick to get used to the movements and where the stick should be at each stage of the stride.</p>

<p>I think I worked harder than I have for a while in that training session, you are in 8 - 10 degree air, on a frozen pool of water and yet I still had sweat dripping from my face and nose! It was so difficult to do what was asked of us, but I tried to do everything and did as well as I could, I was having such a great time that I didn't even think about it, well much. Even wearing all that gear I was still a little apprehensive about forwards to backwards transitions but the stick did help to balance when I messed up.</p>

<p>Vicki seemed in her element, but I think she had some issues controlling her stick as well. At least she said did, and I think she did pretty well all things considering. I do know she had a few troubles with how to angle the stick on turns, but she got the hang of it towards the end. I think that was the easy bit for me, turns seemed to be quite easy, but the rest wasn't so easy, I think it was the opposite for Vicki.</p>

<p>I cannot wait for next Thursday though, to do it all again!</p>

<p>Of course Braden was his usual forgetful self at the end of the session. Which is nothing bad, honestly, it was 9pm and he'd spent the last hour racing around so he was tired. He packed his own bag just prior to leaving, and of course left a few things ... Lets see, he left his cup, his pants, that was the first time. Then he came back for his shin pads and one of his gloves ... well I thought we had everything until we got home. Somewhere along the way he lost his mouthguard. For some reason typing that gives me déjà vu, it reminds me of a dream I had, or should I say recall.</p>

<p>So this morning before work I had to go and get him a new one this morning, with every intention of getting him a nice Shock Doctor gel nano that Id seen when looking for something for me. I then saw something a little smaller on the shelf below, and thought that would be much better than the one he had. We ended up boiling it and sizing it for him tonight and wow, what a great fit. So much better than the other one he had, I think he will like this one much better, lets just hope it lasts a little longer!</p>

<p>He is a very happy camper at the moment though, although he is in bed, his Grandma is here for the weekend, and of course he rarely sees her, so it is great for both him and his Grandma! I know he will want to show off to her when she watches him ice skate tomorrow and then again for hockey practice on Sunday morning.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Who knew? Not me, and definitely not Vicki. Three hockey bags full of equipment, three sticks, one adult length, one intermediate, and one junior as well as plenty of room for all of us three. I thought I'd fit it in there, but was amazed at just how much room there is in such a small little car. Of course if we were a bigger family it never would do and we'd have to get the roof rack Vicki was thinking.</p></p>

<p>I am very glad that everything fits in the car as I didn't want to have to buy more stuff just to get to and from hockey, nor did I want to have to drive two cars as it would cost us a fortune in tolls!</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the day Vicki and I take to the ice for the first time in full hockey equipment, it is going to be rather interesting and I for one will probably get little sleep tonight just thinking about it.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>And it is only Tuesday.</p></p>

<p>Strange I know, but for some reason I've not been sleeping well of late, I think my brain is just still too active, thinking and thinking. It happens when work is busy and I have a few 'interesting' cases, unfortunately I'm one of those people that keep thinking about things as I tend to have a few <em>lightbulb</em> moments out of work hours.</p>

<p>The other thing keeping me up last night was making sure I woke up early enough to go and fill up my car with petrol/gas and get ready to take Braden to school and head into the office. Yes there was an ulterior motive, I went into town to pick up the helmets for Vicki and myself and also get all of our skates sharpened. It was great to have a chat to Kirk, although he was very busy unfortunately as he was down a couple of guys today. I hope his day raced by though. Vicki has a shiny new black Easton helmet with a full face cage and I have a mostly shiny new white Easton helmet with a visor. I just couldn't live with the full cage as the padded chin strap kept digging into my adams apple. They are all sized up correctly now and we are ready to start training on Thursday. Although we still need to learn how to get dressed properly.</p>

<p>There really isn't any other news of worth at the moment, we are all pretty quiet at home and even skipped the cheap skate night tonight as we are all feeling rather tired and a little run down.</p></section>

          <p><section><p>Too many things this week!</p></p>

<p>First one is the count down to donning the hockey gear and getting on the ice to learn how to play ice hockey. This is going to be a most interesting experience! I've already expressed some apprehension as sometimes I feel like all left feet when on the ice, but I think this will ultimately make me a much better skater. Then again, speaking to the development coach (Matt) yesterday gave me a little insight to some of the things we will be doing. One such thing was to skate on one leg, and then bend that leg and straighten etc, this is to improve a) leg strength and b) balance. I thought to myself , gee I can't even do that while standing in sneakers, how am I going to do that on the ice, on skates! I tried it, and you know what, I could actually do it, on both legs I was quite shocked, but I tell you it does put some strain on your quads, but in a good way. So yesterday was spent trying a few things out, mucking around and then the best bit, getting the remainder of the hockey equipment to borrow for both Vicki and I. It was good to have everything, although the only pants they really had in my size were bright red and extremely heavy. I opted for a pair a little smaller to get me by, but I tell you what if I had of worn the other pants I think I'd be able to stand in front of a nuclear blast and not feel a thing on my thighs!</p>

<p>Tomorrow will be the day I go into Skatebiz and pick up our helmets, looking forward to that bit. I'll also be taking four pairs of skates in for sharpening, yes you heard me right: four! No we've not got a new member to the family or skating family, Vicki couldn't pass up a deal yesterday, a pair of near new Graf skates for $80, skates that retail for $200. They are in pretty good condition and Vicki will use them as her ice hockey skates as they are one size (Euro sizing) smaller than her current ones and fit that little bit snugger. I still want to get some new skates, but really cannot justify the $500+ for a new pair of skates that will last me a long time, now if I could sell my old ones I'd seriously think about it, mind you Vicki would kill me, seriously kill me, as in dead, I'm sure she'd stab me in the middle of the night with those $500 skates! So they can wait for a while, or I'll use my own money to buy them instead of dipping into the ice hockey funding.</p>

<p>Yesterday the Rangers and the Caps played game seven of their series, and the Rangers came out on top, not even an overtime game at that! That means that the Devils will now play the Rangers for the Conference finals, and the winner will head to the Stanley Cup finals. I am rooting for the Devils on this one, and really hope they keep up the level headedness they have shown during the last games against the Flyers. The Eastern Conference finals start today, and the first game between the Kings and the Coyotes is underway, I am not looking at the scores as I would like to watch the game without knowing the score (just for once). Everybody is saying the Kings are on fire, and are going to blitz the Coyotes, I think the Kings have peaked while the other teams have been on a downward spiral, but the Coyotes have also picked up their game as well. For me I want the Coyotes to advance and to knock the Kings off of their pedestal. We shall soon see in the next four to seven games who will come out on top.</p>

<p>Yesterday was also Mother's Day across the world, Braden and I let Vicki decide what she wanted to do and of course she picked ice skating, which neither of us mind at all. I gave Braden some money on Friday to visit the Mother's Day stall at school so he could pick out a present for Vicki. He ended up choosing a nice little jar of Vanilla Bath Salts, I am not sure how he realised she loved Vanilla, but he did well and Vicki was very happy with it. Braden and I got her a Devils jersey for Mother's Day, although it was supposed to be for her Birthday! It was customised with her favourite player, Zach Parise, and she absolutely loves it, she wore it skating yesterday and was very proud of it.</p></section>
